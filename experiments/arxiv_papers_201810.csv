challenging task, where it is difficult to form even a Gaussian approximation
to the posterior distribution. In such situations, existing methods usually
resort to a diagonal approximation of the covariance matrix despite, the fact
that these matrices are known to result in poor uncertainty estimates. To
address this issue, we propose a new stochastic, low-rank, approximate
natural-gradient (SLANG) method for variational inference in large, deep
models. Our method estimates a ""diagonal plus low-rank"" structure based solely
on back-propagated gradients of the network log-likelihood. This requires
strictly less gradient computations than methods that compute the gradient of
the whole variational objective. Empirical evaluations on standard benchmarks
confirm that SLANG enables faster and more accurate estimation of uncertainty
than mean-field methods, and performs comparably to state-of-the-art methods.","['Aaron Mishkin', 'Frederik Kunstner', 'Didrik Nielsen', 'Mark Schmidt', 'Mohammad Emtiyaz Khan']","['cs.LG', 'cs.AI', 'stat.ML']",2018-11-11 23:18:27+00:00

been previously proposed as one of the state-of-the-art multi-view dimension
reduction techniques, how to make the representation discriminative with only a
small amount of labeled data is not well-studied. We introduce a
semi-supervised neural network model, named Multi-view Discriminative Neural
Network (MDNN), for multi-view problems. MDNN finds nonlinear view-specific
mappings by projecting samples to a common feature space using multiple coupled
deep networks. It is capable of leveraging both labeled and unlabeled data to
project multi-view data so that samples from different classes are separated
and those from the same class are clustered together. It also uses the
inter-view correlation between views to exploit the available information in
both the labeled and unlabeled data. Extensive experiments conducted on four
datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm for multi-view
semi-supervised learning.","['Vahid Noroozi', 'Sara Bahaadini', 'Lei Zheng', 'Sihong Xie', 'Weixiang Shao', 'Philip S. Yu']","['cs.LG', 'stat.ML']",2018-11-11 20:53:50+00:00

campaigns across multiple publishers affiliated to an RTB ad exchange. While
driving multiple campaigns for mobile app install ads via RTB, the bidder
typically has to: (i) maintain each campaign's efficiency (i.e., meet
advertiser's target cost-per-install), (ii) be sensitive to advertiser's
budget, and (iii) make profit after payouts to the ad exchange. In this
process, there is a sense of delayed rewards for the bidder's actions; the
exchange charges the bidder right after the ad is shown, but the bidder gets to
know about resultant installs after considerable delay. This makes it
challenging for the bidder to decide beforehand the bid (and corresponding cost
charged to advertiser) for each ad display opportunity. To jointly handle the
objectives mentioned above, we propose a state space based policy which decides
the exchange bid and advertiser cost for each opportunity. The state space
captures the current efficiency, budget utilization and profit. The policy
based on this state space is trained on past decisions and outcomes via a novel
Q-learning algorithm which accounts for the delay in install notifications. In
our experiments based on data from app install campaigns managed by Yahoo's
Gemini advertising platform, the Q-learning based policy led to a significant
increase in the profit and number of efficient campaigns.","['Anit Kumar Sahu', 'Shaunak Mishra', 'Narayan Bhamidipati']","['cs.GT', 'cs.LG', 'stat.ML']",2018-11-11 20:42:09+00:00

of agents known as pursuers coordinate their traversal of a spatial domain to
locate an agent trying to evade them. Pursuit evasion problems arise in a
number of import application domains including defense and route planning.
Learning to optimally coordinate pursuer behaviors so as to minimize time to
capture of the evader is challenging because of a large action space and sparse
noisy state information; consequently, previous approaches have relied
primarily on heuristics. We propose a variant of Thompson Sampling for
pursuit-evasion that allows for the application of existing model-based
planning algorithms. This approach is general in that it allows for an
arbitrary number of pursuers, a general spatial domain, and the integration of
auxiliary information provided by informants. In a suite of simulation
experiments, Thompson Sampling for pursuit evasion significantly reduces
time-to-capture relative to competing algorithms.","['Zhen Li', 'Nicholas J. Meyer', 'Eric B. Laber', 'Robert Brigantic']","['cs.LG', 'stat.ML']",2018-11-11 20:17:01+00:00
http://arxiv.org/abs/1811.04463v1,Machine Learning with Abstention for Automated Liver Disease Diagnosis,"This paper presents a novel approach for detection of liver abnormalities in
an automated manner using ultrasound images. For this purpose, we have
implemented a machine learning model that can not only generate labels (normal
and abnormal) for a given ultrasound image but it can also detect when its
prediction is likely to be incorrect. The proposed model abstains from
generating the label of a test example if it is not confident about its
prediction. Such behavior is commonly practiced by medical doctors who, when
given insufficient information or a difficult case, can chose to carry out
further clinical or diagnostic tests before generating a diagnosis. However,
existing machine learning models are designed in a way to always generate a
label for a given example even when the confidence of their prediction is low.
We have proposed a novel stochastic gradient based solver for the learning with
abstention paradigm and use it to make a practical, state of the art method for
liver disease classification. The proposed method has been benchmarked on a
data set of approximately 100 patients from MINAR, Multan, Pakistan and our
results show that the proposed scheme offers state of the art classification
performance.","['Kanza Hamid', 'Amina Asif', 'Wajid Abbasi', 'Durre Sabih', 'Fayyaz Minhas']","['cs.LG', 'cs.CV', 'eess.IV', 'stat.ML']",2018-11-11 19:37:40+00:00
http://arxiv.org/abs/1811.04455v2,Learning with tree-based tensor formats,"This paper is concerned with the approximation of high-dimensional functions
in a statistical learning setting, by empirical risk minimization over model
classes of functions in tree-based tensor format. These are particular classes
of rank-structured functions that can be seen as deep neural networks with a
sparse architecture related to the tree and multilinear activation functions.
For learning in a given model class, we exploit the fact that tree-based tensor
formats are multilinear models and recast the problem of risk minimization over
a nonlinear set into a succession of learning problems with linear models.
Suitable changes of representation yield numerically stable learning problems
and allow to exploit sparsity. For high-dimensional problems or when only a
small data set is available, the selection of a good model class is a critical
issue. For a given tree, the selection of the tuple of tree-based ranks that
minimize the risk is a combinatorial problem. Here, we propose a rank
adaptation strategy which provides in practice a good convergence of the risk
as a function of the model class complexity. Finding a good tree is also a
combinatorial problem, which can be related to the choice of a particular
sparse architecture for deep neural networks. Here, we propose a stochastic
algorithm for minimizing the complexity of the representation of a given
function over a class of trees with a given arity, allowing changes in the
topology of the tree. This tree optimization algorithm is then included in a
learning scheme that successively adapts the tree and the corresponding
tree-based ranks. Contrary to classical learning algorithms for nonlinear model
classes, the proposed algorithms are numerically stable, reliable, and require
only a low level expertise of the user.","['Erwan Grelier', 'Anthony Nouy', 'Mathilde Chevreuil']","['stat.ML', 'cs.LG', 'math.NA']",2018-11-11 19:03:31+00:00

machine-learning research. The key challenges are learning representations and
formulating inference methods that take into account the complementarity and
redundancy of various information sources. In this paper we formulate a
variational autoencoder based multi-source learning framework in which each
encoder is conditioned on a different information source. This allows us to
relate the sources via the shared latent variables by computing divergence
measures between individual source's posterior approximations. We explore a
variety of options to learn these encoders and to integrate the beliefs they
compute into a consistent posterior approximation. We visualise learned beliefs
on a toy dataset and evaluate our methods for learning shared representations
and structured output prediction, showing trade-offs of learning separate
encoders for each information source. Furthermore, we demonstrate how conflict
detection and redundancy can increase robustness of inference in a multi-source

http://arxiv.org/abs/1811.07771v2,"A Multi-Task Learning & Generation Framework: Valence-Arousal, Action Units & Primary Expressions","Over the past few years many research efforts have been devoted to the field
of affect analysis. Various approaches have been proposed for: i) discrete
emotion recognition in terms of the primary facial expressions; ii) emotion
analysis in terms of facial Action Units (AUs), assuming a fixed expression
intensity; iii) dimensional emotion analysis, in terms of valence and arousal
(VA). These approaches can only be effective, if they are developed using
large, appropriately annotated databases, showing behaviors of people
in-the-wild, i.e., in uncontrolled environments. Aff-Wild has been the first,
large-scale, in-the-wild database (including around 1,200,000 frames of 300
videos), annotated in terms of VA. In the vast majority of existing emotion
databases, their annotation is limited to either primary expressions, or
valence-arousal, or action units. In this paper, we first annotate a part
(around $234,000$ frames) of the Aff-Wild database in terms of $8$ AUs and
another part (around $288,000$ frames) in terms of the $7$ basic emotion
categories, so that parts of this database are annotated in terms of VA, as
well as AUs, or primary expressions. Then, we set up and tackle multi-task
learning for emotion recognition, as well as for facial image generation.
Multi-task learning is performed using: i) a deep neural network with shared
hidden layers, which learns emotional attributes by exploiting their
inter-dependencies; ii) a discriminator of a generative adversarial network
(GAN). On the other hand, image generation is implemented through the generator
of the GAN. For these two tasks, we carefully design loss functions that fit
the examined set-up. Experiments are presented which illustrate the good
performance of the proposed approach when applied to the new annotated parts of
the Aff-Wild database.","['Dimitrios Kollias', 'Stefanos Zafeiriou']","['cs.CV', 'cs.AI', 'cs.LG', 'stat.ML']",2018-11-11 15:40:23+00:00

http://arxiv.org/abs/1811.04411v2,Fast Matrix Factorization with Non-Uniform Weights on Missing Data,"Matrix factorization (MF) has been widely used to discover the low-rank
structure and to predict the missing entries of data matrix. In many real-world
learning systems, the data matrix can be very high-dimensional but sparse. This
poses an imbalanced learning problem, since the scale of missing entries is
usually much larger than that of observed entries, but they cannot be ignored
due to the valuable negative signal. For efficiency concern, existing work
typically applies a uniform weight on missing entries to allow a fast learning
algorithm. However, this simplification will decrease modeling fidelity,
resulting in suboptimal performance for downstream applications.
  In this work, we weight the missing data non-uniformly, and more generically,
we allow any weighting strategy on the missing data. To address the efficiency
challenge, we propose a fast learning method, for which the time complexity is
determined by the number of observed entries in the data matrix, rather than
the matrix size. The key idea is two-fold: 1) we apply truncated SVD on the
weight matrix to get a more compact representation of the weights, and 2) we
learn MF parameters with element-wise alternating least squares (eALS) and
memorize the key intermediate variables to avoid repeating computations that
are unnecessary. We conduct extensive experiments on two recommendation
benchmarks, demonstrating the correctness, efficiency, and effectiveness of our
fast eALS method.","['Xiangnan He', 'Jinhui Tang', 'Xiaoyu Du', 'Richang Hong', 'Tongwei Ren', 'Tat-Seng Chua']","['cs.IR', 'cs.LG', 'stat.ML']",2018-11-11 13:17:42+00:00

errors in the future, from time to time. These errors are usually unexpected,
and can lead to dramatic consequences. Intensive development of AI and its
practical applications makes the problem of errors more important. Total
re-engineering of the systems can create new errors and is not always possible
due to the resources involved. The important challenge is to develop fast
methods to correct errors without damaging existing skills. We formulated the
technical requirements to the 'ideal' correctors. Such correctors include
binary classifiers, which separate the situations with high risk of errors from
the situations where the AI systems work properly. Surprisingly, for
essentially high-dimensional data such methods are possible: simple linear
Fisher discriminant can separate the situations with errors from correctly
solved tasks even for exponentially large samples. The paper presents the
probabilistic basis for fast non-destructive correction of AI systems. A series
of new stochastic separation theorems is proven. These theorems provide new
instruments for fast non-iterative correction of errors of legacy AI systems.

functions are chosen, a comprehensive theoretical understanding of VRM is still

with vicinal functions can be controlled by that of the original function
classes under the assumption that the function class is composed of
Lipschitz-continuous functions. Then, the resulting generalization bounds for
VRM suggest that the generalization performance of VRM is also effected by the
choice of vicinity function and the quality of function classes. These findings
can be used to examine whether the choice of vicinal function is appropriate

that has attracted significant interest over the past 20 years. However, human
emotional states are quite complex. To appraise such states displayed in
real-world settings, we need expressive emotional descriptors that are capable
of capturing and describing this complexity. The circumplex model of affect,
which is described in terms of valence (i.e., how positive or negative is an
emotion) and arousal (i.e., power of the activation of the emotion), can be
used for this purpose. Recent progress in the emotion recognition domain has
been achieved through the development of deep neural architectures and the
availability of very large training databases. To this end, Aff-Wild has been
the first large-scale ""in-the-wild"" database, containing around 1,200,000
frames. In this paper, we build upon this database, extending it with 260 more
subjects and 1,413,000 new video frames. We call the union of Aff-Wild with the
additional data, Aff-Wild2. The videos are downloaded from Youtube and have
large variations in pose, age, illumination conditions, ethnicity and
profession. Both database-specific as well as cross-database experiments are
performed in this paper, by utilizing the Aff-Wild2, along with the RECOLA
database. The developed deep neural architectures are based on the joint
training of state-of-the-art convolutional and recurrent neural networks with
attention mechanism; thus exploiting both the invariant properties of
convolutional features, while modeling temporal dynamics that arise in human
behaviour via the recurrent layers. The obtained results show premise for
utilization of the extended Aff-Wild, as well as of the developed deep neural
architectures for visual analysis of human behaviour in terms of continuous
emotion dimensions.","['Dimitrios Kollias', 'Stefanos Zafeiriou']","['cs.CV', 'cs.AI', 'cs.LG', 'stat.ML']",2018-11-11 01:57:15+00:00
http://arxiv.org/abs/1811.04324v2,Diversity-Driven Extensible Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning,"Hierarchical reinforcement learning (HRL) has recently shown promising
advances on speeding up learning, improving the exploration, and discovering
intertask transferable skills. Most recent works focus on HRL with two levels,
i.e., a master policy manipulates subpolicies, which in turn manipulate
primitive actions. However, HRL with multiple levels is usually needed in many
real-world scenarios, whose ultimate goals are highly abstract, while their
actions are very primitive. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a
diversity-driven extensible HRL (DEHRL), where an extensible and scalable
framework is built and learned levelwise to realize HRL with multiple levels.
DEHRL follows a popular assumption: diverse subpolicies are useful, i.e.,
subpolicies are believed to be more useful if they are more diverse. However,
existing implementations of this diversity assumption usually have their own
drawbacks, which makes them inapplicable to HRL with multiple levels.
Consequently, we further propose a novel diversity-driven solution to achieve
this assumption in DEHRL. Experimental studies evaluate DEHRL with five
baselines from four perspectives in two domains; the results show that DEHRL
outperforms the state-of-the-art baselines in all four aspects.","['Yuhang Song', 'Jianyi Wang', 'Thomas Lukasiewicz', 'Zhenghua Xu', 'Mai Xu']","['cs.LG', 'stat.ML']",2018-11-10 23:35:34+00:00

many sources, such as sensor faults. Accordingly, anomaly detection is
important both for analyzing the anomalies themselves and for cleaning the data
for further analysis of its ambient structure. Nonetheless, a precise
definition of anomalies is important for automated detection and herein we
approach such problems from the perspective of detecting sparse latent effects
embedded in large collections of noisy data. Standard Graphical Lasso-based
techniques can identify the conditional dependency structure of a collection of
random variables based on their sample covariance matrix. However, classic
Graphical Lasso is sensitive to outliers in the sample covariance matrix. In
particular, several outliers in a sample covariance matrix can destroy the
sparsity of its inverse. Accordingly, we propose a novel optimization problem
that is similar in spirit to Robust Principal Component Analysis (RPCA) and
splits the sample covariance matrix $M$ into two parts, $M=F+S$, where $F$ is
the cleaned sample covariance whose inverse is sparse and computable by
Graphical Lasso, and $S$ contains the outliers in $M$. We accomplish this
decomposition by adding an additional $ \ell_1$ penalty to classic Graphical
Lasso, and name it ""Robust Graphical Lasso (Rglasso)"". Moreover, we propose an
Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) solution to the optimization
problem which scales to large numbers of unknowns. We evaluate our algorithm on

translator for mathematical formulae based on recursive neural networks. We
chose recursive neural networks because mathematical formulae inherently
include a structural encoding. In our implementation, we developed new
techniques and topologies for recursive tree-to-tree neural networks based on
multi-variate multi-valued Long Short-Term Memory cells. We propose a novel
approach for mini-batch training that utilizes clustering and tree traversal.
We evaluate our translator and analyze the behavior of our proposed topologies

notation. We use the semantic LaTeX notation from the Digital Library for
Mathematical Formulae and the Digital Repository for Mathematical Formulae at
the National Institute for Standards and Technology. We find that a simple
heuristics-based clustering algorithm outperforms the conventional clustering
algorithms on the task of clustering binary trees of mathematical formulae with
respect to their topology. Furthermore, we find a mask for the loss function,
which can prevent the neural network from finding a local minimum of the loss
function. Given our preliminary results, a complete translation from formula to
formula is not yet possible. However, we achieved a prediction accuracy of
47.05% for predicting symbols at the correct position and an accuracy of 92.3%
when ignoring the predicted position. Concluding, our work advances the field
of recursive neural networks by improving the training speed and quality of

of sequential data problems. A well known difficulty in using RNNs is the
\textit{vanishing or exploding gradient} problem. Recently, there have been
several different RNN architectures that try to mitigate this issue by
maintaining an orthogonal or unitary recurrent weight matrix. One such
architecture is the scaled Cayley orthogonal recurrent neural network (scoRNN)
which parameterizes the orthogonal recurrent weight matrix through a scaled
Cayley transform. This parametrization contains a diagonal scaling matrix
consisting of positive or negative one entries that can not be optimized by
gradient descent. Thus the scaling matrix is fixed before training and a
hyperparameter is introduced to tune the matrix for each particular task. In
this paper, we develop a unitary RNN architecture based on a complex scaled
Cayley transform. Unlike the real orthogonal case, the transformation uses a
diagonal scaling matrix consisting of entries on the complex unit circle which
can be optimized using gradient descent and no longer requires the tuning of a
hyperparameter. We also provide an analysis of a potential issue of the modReLU
activiation function which is used in our work and several other unitary RNNs.

deductive algorithms to deal with noise in the data, it has been argued that
alternative means of reasoning should be investigated which bear high promise

any sequence of play that achieves a favorable regret with respect to one
definition must do poorly with respect to the other. We then focus on the
game-theoretic setting where the adversary is a self-interested agent. In that
setting, we show that external regret and policy regret are not in conflict
and, in fact, that a wide class of algorithms can ensure a favorable regret
with respect to both definitions, so long as the adversary is also using such
an algorithm. We also show that the sequence of play of no-policy regret
algorithms converges to a \emph{policy equilibrium}, a new notion of
equilibrium that we introduce. Relating this back to external regret, we show
that coarse correlated equilibria, which no-external regret players converge
to, are a strict subset of policy equilibria. Thus, in game-theoretic settings,
every sequence of play with no external regret also admits no policy regret,

the random initialization, the optimization landscape is almost-convex and
semi-smooth even with ReLU activations. This implies an equivalence between
over-parameterized neural networks and neural tangent kernel (NTK) in the
finite (and polynomial) width setting.
  As concrete examples, starting from randomly initialized weights, we prove
that SGD can attain 100% training accuracy in classification tasks, or minimize
regression loss in linear convergence speed, with running time polynomial in
$n,L$. Our theory applies to the widely-used but non-smooth ReLU activation,
and to any smooth and possibly non-convex loss functions. In terms of network
architectures, our theory at least applies to fully-connected neural networks,
convolutional neural networks (CNN), and residual neural networks (ResNet).","['Zeyuan Allen-Zhu', 'Yuanzhi Li', 'Zhao Song']","['cs.LG', 'cs.DS', 'cs.NE', 'math.OC', 'stat.ML']",2018-11-09 15:16:13+00:00
http://arxiv.org/abs/1811.04803v2,Observability Properties of Colored Graphs,"A colored graph is a directed graph in which nodes or edges have been
assigned colors that are not necessarily unique. Observability problems in such
graphs consider whether an agent observing the colors of edges or nodes
traversed on a path in the graph can determine which node they are at currently
or which nodes were visited earlier in the traversal. Previous research efforts
have identified several different notions of observability as well as the
associated properties of graphs for which those observability properties hold.
This paper unifies the prior work into a common framework with several new
results about relationships between those notions and associated graph
properties. The new framework provides an intuitive way to reason about the
attainable accuracy as a function of lag and time spent observing, and
identifies simple modifications to improve the observability of a given graph.
We show that one form of the graph modification problem is in NP-Complete. The
intuition of the new framework is borne out with numerical experiments. This
work has implications for problems that can be described in terms of an agent
traversing a colored graph, including the reconstruction of hidden states in a
hidden Markov model (HMM).","['Mark Chilenski', 'George Cybenko', 'Isaac Dekine', 'Piyush Kumar', 'Gil Raz']","['cs.LG', 'math.CO', 'stat.ML']",2018-11-09 15:12:24+00:00

Theoretical justifications for the effectiveness of the SML algorithms are
underpinned by sound principles from different disciplines, such as Computer
Science and Statistics. The theoretical underpinnings particularly justified by
statistical inference methods are together termed as statistical learning
theory.
  This paper provides a review of SML from a Bayesian decision theoretic point
of view -- where we argue that many SML techniques are closely connected to
making inference by using the so called Bayesian paradigm. We discuss many
important SML techniques such as supervised and unsupervised learning, deep
learning, online learning and Gaussian processes especially in the context of
very large data sets where these are often employed. We present a dictionary
which maps the key concepts of SML from Computer Science and Statistics. We
illustrate the SML techniques with three moderately large data sets where we
also discuss many practical implementation issues. Thus the review is
especially targeted at statisticians and computer scientists who are aspiring
to understand and apply SML for moderately large to big data sets.","['Rajiv Sambasivan', 'Sourish Das', 'Sujit K Sahu']","['cs.LG', 'stat.ME', 'stat.ML']",2018-11-09 14:26:55+00:00

bound can be learned to total variation distance error $\epsilon$ using

specifically, we use zeroth order optimization algorithms to find such a
universal adversarial perturbation when no model information is revealed-except
that the attacker can make queries to probe the classifier. We further relax
the assumption that the output of a query is continuous valued confidence
scores for all the classes and consider the case where the output is a
hard-label decision. Surprisingly, we found that even in these extremely
obscure regimes, state-of-the-art ML classifiers can be fooled with a very high
probability just by adding a single human-imperceptible image perturbation to

this type of attack is challenging because the unexpected behavior occurs only

this task, it is important to minimize the preprocessing cost of the procedure

end, we propose a new determinantal point process algorithm which has the
following two properties, both of which are novel: (1) a preprocessing step

new regularized determinantal point process (R-DPP), which serves as an
intermediate distribution in the sampling procedure by reducing the number of
rows from $n$ to $\text{poly}(d)$. Crucially, this intermediate distribution
does not distort the probabilities of the target sample. Our key novelty in
defining the R-DPP is the use of a Poisson random variable for controlling the
probabilities of different subset sizes, leading to new determinantal formulas

operations gained popularity as well. While many of those operations seem
appealing, little is reported about wall-clock training time improvements. In

networks (CNN), but could suffer from significant communication costs caused by
gradient aggregation. To alleviate this problem, several scalar quantization
techniques have been developed to compress the gradients. But these techniques
could perform poorly when used together with decentralized aggregation
protocols like ring all-reduce (RAR), mainly due to their inability to directly
aggregate compressed gradients. In this paper, we empirically demonstrate the
strong linear correlations between CNN gradients, and propose a gradient vector
quantization technique, named GradiVeQ, to exploit these correlations through
principal component analysis (PCA) for substantial gradient dimension
reduction. GradiVeQ enables direct aggregation of compressed gradients, hence
allows us to build a distributed learning system that parallelizes GradiVeQ
gradient compression and RAR communications. Extensive experiments on popular
CNNs demonstrate that applying GradiVeQ slashes the wall-clock gradient
aggregation time of the original RAR by more than 5X without noticeable
accuracy loss, and reduces the end-to-end training time by almost 50%. The

  As a first step, we develop a simple yet meaningful graph representation, and

Interestingly, this simple representation achieves similar performance as the

representations. Traditionally, data representations were hand-crafted.
Recently it has been demonstrated that, given sufficient data, deep neural
networks can learn effective implicit representations from simple input
representations. However, for most scientific problems, the use of deep
learning is not appropriate as the amount of available data is limited, and/or
the output models must be explainable. Nevertheless, many scientific problems
do have significant amounts of data available on related tasks, which makes
them amenable to multi-task learning, i.e. learning many related problems
simultaneously. Here we propose a novel and general representation learning
approach for multi-task learning that works successfully with small amounts of
data. The fundamental new idea is to transform an input intrinsic data
representation (i.e., handcrafted features), to an extrinsic representation
based on what a pre-trained set of models predict about the examples. This
transformation has the dual advantages of producing significantly more accurate
predictions, and providing explainable models. To demonstrate the utility of
this transformative learning approach, we have applied it to three real-world
scientific problems: drug-design (quantitative structure activity relationship
learning), predicting human gene expression (across different tissue types and
drug treatments), and meta-learning for machine learning (predicting which

http://arxiv.org/abs/1811.03388v2,Knowledge Tracing Machines: Factorization Machines for Knowledge Tracing,"Knowledge tracing is a sequence prediction problem where the goal is to
predict the outcomes of students over questions as they are interacting with a
learning platform. By tracking the evolution of the knowledge of some student,
one can optimize instruction. Existing methods are either based on temporal
latent variable models, or factor analysis with temporal features. We here show
that factorization machines (FMs), a model for regression or classification,
encompasses several existing models in the educational literature as special
cases, notably additive factor model, performance factor model, and
multidimensional item response theory. We show, using several real datasets of
tens of thousands of users and items, that FMs can estimate student knowledge
accurately and fast even when student data is sparsely observed, and handle
side information such as multiple knowledge components and number of attempts
at item or skill level. Our approach allows to fit student models of higher
dimension than existing models, and provides a testbed to try new combinations
of features in order to improve existing models.","['Jill-Jênn Vie', 'Hisashi Kashima']","['cs.IR', 'cs.AI', 'cs.LG', 'stat.ML']",2018-11-08 13:02:09+00:00
http://arxiv.org/abs/1811.03377v1,Spectral Simplicial Theory for Feature Selection and Applications to Genomics,"The scale and complexity of modern data sets and the limitations associated
with testing large numbers of hypotheses underline the need for feature
selection methods. Spectral techniques rank features according to their degree
of consistency with an underlying metric structure, but their current
graph-based formulation restricts their applicability to point features. We
extend spectral methods for feature selection to abstract simplicial complexes
and present a general framework which can be applied to 2-point and
higher-order features. Combinatorial Laplacian scores take into account the
topology spanned by the data and reduce to the ordinary Laplacian score in the
case of point features. We demonstrate the utility of spectral simplicial
methods for feature selection with several examples of application to the
analysis of gene expression and multi-modal genomic data. Our results provide a
unifying perspective on topological data analysis and manifold learning
approaches.","['Kiya W. Govek', 'Venkata S. Yamajala', 'Pablo G. Camara']","['stat.ML', 'cs.LG', 'q-bio.QM']",2018-11-08 12:27:49+00:00
http://arxiv.org/abs/1811.03356v1,Linear Memory Networks,"Recurrent neural networks can learn complex transduction problems that
require maintaining and actively exploiting a memory of their inputs. Such
models traditionally consider memory and input-output functionalities
indissolubly entangled. We introduce a novel recurrent architecture based on
the conceptual separation between the functional input-output transformation
and the memory mechanism, showing how they can be implemented through different
neural components. By building on such conceptualization, we introduce the
Linear Memory Network, a recurrent model comprising a feedforward neural
network, realizing the non-linear functional transformation, and a linear
autoencoder for sequences, implementing the memory component. The resulting
architecture can be efficiently trained by building on closed-form solutions to
linear optimization problems. Further, by exploiting equivalence results
between feedforward and recurrent neural networks we devise a pretraining
schema for the proposed architecture. Experiments on polyphonic music datasets
show competitive results against gated recurrent networks and other state of
the art models.","['Davide Bacciu', 'Antonio Carta', 'Alessandro Sperduti']","['cs.LG', 'stat.ML']",2018-11-08 11:08:04+00:00
http://arxiv.org/abs/1811.03322v2,Using Known Information to Accelerate HyperParameters Optimization Based on SMBO,"Automl is the key technology for machine learning problem. Current state of
art hyperparameter optimization methods are based on traditional black-box
optimization methods like SMBO (SMAC, TPE). The objective function of black-box
optimization is non-smooth, or time-consuming to evaluate, or in some way
noisy. Recent years, many researchers offered the work about the properties of
hyperparameters. However, traditional hyperparameter optimization methods do
not take those information into consideration. In this paper, we use gradient
information and machine learning model analysis information to accelerate
traditional hyperparameter optimization methods SMBO. In our L2 norm
experiments, our method yielded state-of-the-art performance, and in many cases
outperformed the previous best configuration approach.","['Cheng Daning', 'Zhang Hanping', 'Xia Fen', 'Li Shigang', 'Zhang Yunquan']","['cs.LG', 'stat.ML']",2018-11-08 09:04:09+00:00
