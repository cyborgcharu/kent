http://arxiv.org/abs/1705.07366v1,Forward Thinking: Building Deep Random Forests,"The success of deep neural networks has inspired many to wonder whether other
learners could benefit from deep, layered architectures. We present a general
framework called forward thinking for deep learning that generalizes the
architectural flexibility and sophistication of deep neural networks while also
allowing for (i) different types of learning functions in the network, other
than neurons, and (ii) the ability to adaptively deepen the network as needed
to improve results. This is done by training one layer at a time, and once a
layer is trained, the input data are mapped forward through the layer to create
a new learning problem. The process is then repeated, transforming the data
through multiple layers, one at a time, rendering a new dataset, which is
expected to be better behaved, and on which a final output layer can achieve
good performance. In the case where the neurons of deep neural nets are
replaced with decision trees, we call the result a Forward Thinking Deep Random
Forest (FTDRF). We demonstrate a proof of concept by applying FTDRF on the
MNIST dataset. We also provide a general mathematical formulation that allows
for other types of deep learning problems to be considered.","['Kevin Miller', 'Chris Hettinger', 'Jeffrey Humpherys', 'Tyler Jarvis', 'David Kartchner']","['stat.ML', 'cs.LG']",2017-05-20 22:39:51+00:00

communicating the location of food source. After over 60 years of its
discovery, researchers still use manual labeling by watching hours of dance
videos to detect different transitions between dance components thus extracting
information regarding the distance and direction to the food source. We propose
an automated process to monitor and segment different components of honeybee

http://arxiv.org/abs/1705.07349v5,"$\left( Î², \varpi \right)$-stability for cross-validation and the choice of the number of folds","In this paper, we introduce a new concept of stability for cross-validation,
called the $\left( \beta, \varpi \right)$-stability, and use it as a new
perspective to build the general theory for cross-validation. The $\left(
\beta, \varpi \right)$-stability mathematically connects the generalization
ability and the stability of the cross-validated model via the Rademacher
complexity. Our result reveals mathematically the effect of cross-validation
from two sides: on one hand, cross-validation picks the model with the best
empirical generalization ability by validating all the alternatives on test
sets; on the other hand, cross-validation may compromise the stability of the
model selection by causing subsampling error. Moreover, the difference between
training and test errors in q\textsuperscript{th} round, sometimes referred to
as the generalization error, might be autocorrelated on q. Guided by the ideas
above, the $\left( \beta, \varpi \right)$-stability help us derivd a new class
of Rademacher bounds, referred to as the one-round/convoluted Rademacher
bounds, for the stability of cross-validation in both the i.i.d.\ and
non-i.i.d.\ cases. For both light-tail and heavy-tail losses, the new bounds
quantify the stability of the one-round/average test error of the
cross-validated model in terms of its one-round/average training error, the
sample sizes $n$, number of folds $K$, the tail property of the loss (encoded
as Orlicz-$\Psi_\nu$ norms) and the Rademacher complexity of the model class
$\Lambda$. The new class of bounds not only quantitatively reveals the
stability of the generalization ability of the cross-validated model, it also
shows empirically the optimal choice for number of folds $K$, at which the
upper bound of the one-round/average test error is lowest, or, to put it in
another way, where the test error is most stable.","['Ning Xu', 'Jian Hong', 'Timothy C. G. Fisher']","['stat.ML', 'cs.LG', 'math.ST', 'stat.TH']",2017-05-20 19:46:01+00:00

between high power and ensuring control over a desired loss function. In many
settings, the points most likely to be misclassified are those who lie near the
decision boundary of the given classification method. Often, these
uninformative points should not be classified as they are noisy and do not
exhibit strong signals. In this paper, we introduce the Thresholding Method to
parameterize the problem of determining which points exhibit strong signals and
should be classified. We demonstrate the empirical performance of this novel
calibration method in providing loss function control at a desired level, as
well as explore how the method assuages the effect of overfitting. We explore
the benefits of error control through the Thresholding Method in difficult,
high-dimensional, simulated settings. Finally, we show the flexibility of the

noise with pre-defined magnitude to different parts of the neural network
during training. It was recently shown that Bayesian dropout procedure not only
improves generalization but also leads to extremely sparse neural architectures
by automatically setting the individual noise magnitude per weight. However,
this sparsity can hardly be used for acceleration since it is unstructured. In
the paper, we propose a new Bayesian model that takes into account the
computational structure of neural networks and provides structured sparsity,
e.g. removes neurons and/or convolutional channels in CNNs. To do this we
inject noise to the neurons outputs while keeping the weights unregularized. We
establish the probabilistic model with a proper truncated log-uniform prior
over the noise and truncated log-normal variational approximation that ensures
that the KL-term in the evidence lower bound is computed in closed-form. The
model leads to structured sparsity by removing elements with a low SNR from the
computation graph and provides significant acceleration on a number of deep
neural architectures. The model is easy to implement as it can be formulated as
a separate dropout-like layer.","['Kirill Neklyudov', 'Dmitry Molchanov', 'Arsenii Ashukha', 'Dmitry Vetrov']",['stat.ML'],2017-05-20 09:20:06+00:00

To understand the evolution and propagation of seizures spatially extended sets

filtering scheme using variational Laplace that can be used in the Dynamic
Causal Modelling (DCM) framework [Friston, 2003] to estimate the temporal
dynamics of seizures recorded using either invasive or non-invasive electrical

variables are highly nonlinear. Consequently, for large scale complex problems,
neural networks and regression trees are commonly preferred over linear models
such as Lasso. This work proposes learning the feature nonlinearities by
binning feature values and finding the best fit in each quantile using
non-convex regularized linear regression. The algorithm first captures the
dependence between neighboring quantiles by enforcing smoothness via
piecewise-constant/linear approximation and then selects a sparse subset of
good features. We prove that the proposed algorithm is statistically and
computationally efficient. In particular, it achieves linear rate of
convergence while requiring near-minimal number of samples. Evaluations on
synthetic and real datasets demonstrate that algorithm is competitive with
current state-of-the-art and accurately learns feature nonlinearities. Finally,
we explore an interesting connection between the binning stage of our algorithm

Examples include sequential Monte Carlo inference in robotics, variational
inference in machine learning, and Markov chain Monte Carlo inference in
statistics. A key problem faced by practitioners is measuring the accuracy of
an approximate inference algorithm on a specific data set. This paper
introduces the auxiliary inference divergence estimator (AIDE), an algorithm
for measuring the accuracy of approximate inference algorithms. AIDE is based
on the observation that inference algorithms can be treated as probabilistic
models and the random variables used within the inference algorithm can be
viewed as auxiliary variables. This view leads to a new estimator for the
symmetric KL divergence between the approximating distributions of two
inference algorithms. The paper illustrates application of AIDE to algorithms
for inference in regression, hidden Markov, and Dirichlet process mixture
models. The experiments show that AIDE captures the qualitative behavior of a
broad class of inference algorithms and can detect failure modes of inference
algorithms that are missed by standard heuristics.","['Marco F. Cusumano-Towner', 'Vikash K. Mansinghka']","['stat.ML', 'cs.AI', 'cs.LG']",2017-05-19 23:48:11+00:00
http://arxiv.org/abs/1705.07220v3,Data-adaptive Active Sampling for Efficient Graph-Cognizant Classification,"The present work deals with active sampling of graph nodes representing
training data for binary classification. The graph may be given or constructed
using similarity measures among nodal features. Leveraging the graph for
classification builds on the premise that labels across neighboring nodes are
correlated according to a categorical Markov random field (MRF). This model is
further relaxed to a Gaussian (G)MRF with labels taking continuous values - an
approximation that not only mitigates the combinatorial complexity of the
categorical model, but also offers optimal unbiased soft predictors of the
unlabeled nodes. The proposed sampling strategy is based on querying the node
whose label disclosure is expected to inflict the largest change on the GMRF,
and in this sense it is the most informative on average. Such a strategy
subsumes several measures of expected model change, including uncertainty
sampling, variance minimization, and sampling based on the $\Sigma-$optimality
criterion. A simple yet effective heuristic is also introduced for increasing
the exploration capabilities of the sampler, and reducing bias of the resultant
classifier, by taking into account the confidence on the model label
predictions. The novel sampling strategies are based on quantities that are
readily available without the need for model retraining, rendering them
computationally efficient and scalable to large graphs. Numerical tests using
synthetic and real data demonstrate that the proposed methods achieve accuracy
that is comparable or superior to the state-of-the-art even at reduced runtime.","['Dimitris Berberidis', 'Georgios B. Giannakis']",['stat.ML'],2017-05-19 23:06:50+00:00
http://arxiv.org/abs/1705.07210v2,Two-temperature logistic regression based on the Tsallis divergence,"We develop a variant of multiclass logistic regression that is significantly
more robust to noise. The algorithm has one weight vector per class and the
surrogate loss is a function of the linear activations (one per class). The
surrogate loss of an example with linear activation vector $\mathbf{a}$ and
class $c$ has the form $-\log_{t_1} \exp_{t_2} (a_c - G_{t_2}(\mathbf{a}))$
where the two temperatures $t_1$ and $t_2$ ''temper'' the $\log$ and $\exp$,
respectively, and $G_{t_2}(\mathbf{a})$ is a scalar value that generalizes the
log-partition function. We motivate this loss using the Tsallis divergence. Our
method allows transitioning between non-convex and convex losses by the choice
of the temperature parameters. As the temperature $t_1$ of the logarithm
becomes smaller than the temperature $t_2$ of the exponential, the surrogate
loss becomes ''quasi convex''. Various tunings of the temperatures recover
previous methods and tuning the degree of non-convexity is crucial in the
experiments. In particular, quasi-convexity and boundedness of the loss provide
significant robustness to the outliers. We explain this by showing that $t_1 <
1$ caps the surrogate loss and $t_2 >1$ makes the predictive distribution have
a heavy tail.
  We show that the surrogate loss is Bayes-consistent, even in the non-convex
case. Additionally, we provide efficient iterative algorithms for calculating
the log-partition value only in a few number of iterations. Our compelling
experimental results on large real-world datasets show the advantage of using
the two-temperature variant in the noisy as well as the noise free case.","['Ehsan Amid', 'Manfred K. Warmuth', 'Sriram Srinivasan']","['cs.LG', 'stat.ML']",2017-05-19 22:18:25+00:00

models. Adversarial training injects such examples into training data to
increase robustness. To scale this technique to large datasets, perturbations
are crafted using fast single-step methods that maximize a linear approximation
of the model's loss. We show that this form of adversarial training converges
to a degenerate global minimum, wherein small curvature artifacts near the data
points obfuscate a linear approximation of the loss. The model thus learns to
generate weak perturbations, rather than defend against strong ones. As a
result, we find that adversarial training remains vulnerable to black-box
attacks, where we transfer perturbations computed on undefended models, as well
as to a powerful novel single-step attack that escapes the non-smooth vicinity
of the input data via a small random step. We further introduce Ensemble
Adversarial Training, a technique that augments training data with
perturbations transferred from other models. On ImageNet, Ensemble Adversarial
Training yields models with strong robustness to black-box attacks. In
particular, our most robust model won the first round of the NIPS 2017
competition on Defenses against Adversarial Attacks. However, subsequent work
found that more elaborate black-box attacks could significantly enhance
transferability and reduce the accuracy of our models.","['Florian TramÃ¨r', 'Alexey Kurakin', 'Nicolas Papernot', 'Ian Goodfellow', 'Dan Boneh', 'Patrick McDaniel']","['stat.ML', 'cs.CR', 'cs.LG']",2017-05-19 21:56:43+00:00

framework to directly optimize towards the reward function in structured

incorporates task-specific reward by performing maximum-likelihood updates on
candidate outputs sampled according to an exponentiated payoff distribution,
which gives higher probabilities to candidates that are close to the reference
output. While RAML is notable for its simplicity, efficiency, and its
impressive empirical successes, the theoretical properties of RAML, especially
the behavior of the exponentiated payoff distribution, has not been examined
thoroughly. In this work, we introduce softmax Q-distribution estimation, a
novel theoretical interpretation of RAML, which reveals the relation between
RAML and Bayesian decision theory. The softmax Q-distribution can be regarded
as a smooth approximation of the Bayes decision boundary, and the Bayes
decision rule is achieved by decoding with this Q-distribution. We further show
that RAML is equivalent to approximately estimating the softmax Q-distribution,
with the temperature $\tau$ controlling approximation error. We perform two

stationary points between the empirical and population risks with convergence
guarantees, which describes the landscape of deep neural networks. In addition,
we analyze these properties for deep nonlinear neural networks with sigmoid

widespread use in this domain is the fact that the projection of a dataset onto
its first $K$ principal components minimizes the sum of squared errors between
the original data and the projected data over all possible rank $K$
projections. Thus, PCA provides optimal low-rank representations of data for
least-squares linear regression under standard modeling assumptions. On the
other hand, when the loss function for a prediction problem is not the
least-squares error, PCA is typically a heuristic choice of dimensionality
reduction -- in particular for classification problems under the zero-one loss.
In this paper we target classification problems by proposing a straightforward
alternative to PCA that aims to minimize the difference in margin distribution
between the original and the projected data. Extensive experiments show that
our simple approach typically outperforms PCA on any particular dataset, in
terms of classification error, though this difference is not always
statistically significant, and despite being a filter method is frequently
competitive with Partial Least Squares (PLS) and Lasso on a wide range of
datasets.","['Xianghui Luo', 'Robert J. Durrant']","['stat.ML', 'cs.LG', '62-07, 62H25, 62H30']",2017-05-17 23:45:11+00:00

preferred because it requires no additional infrastructure for deploying an
FWIPS and achieving the position estimation by reusing the available WLAN and
mobile devices, and capable of providing absolute position estimation. For
fingerprinting based positioning (FbP), a model is created to provide reference
values of observable features (e.g., signal strength from access point (AP)) as
a function of location during offline stage. One widely applied method to build
a complete and an accurate reference database (i.e. radio map (RM)) for FWIPS
is carrying out a site survey throughout the region of interest (RoI). Along
the site survey, the readings of received signal strength (RSS) from all
visible APs at each reference point (RP) are collected. This site survey,
however, is time-consuming and labor-intensive, especially in the case that the
RoI is large (e.g., an airport or a big mall). This bottleneck hinders the wide
commercial applications of FWIPS (e.g., proximity promotions in a shopping
center). To diminish the cost of site survey, we propose a probabilistic model,
which combines fingerprinting based positioning (FbP) and RM generation based
on stochastic variational Bayesian inference (SVBI). This SVBI based position
and RSS estimation has three properties: i) being able to predict the
distribution of the estimated position and RSS, ii) treating each observation
of RSS at each RP as an example to learn for FbP and RM generation instead of
using the whole RM as an example, and iii) requiring only one time training of
the SVBI model for both localization and RSS estimation. These benefits make it
outperforms the previous proposed approaches.","['Caifa Zhou', 'Yang Gu']","['stat.ML', 'stat.AP']",2017-05-17 06:48:05+00:00

discriminating power. However, we show that many kernel clustering criteria

artifacts empirically observed in the past. For example, we provide conditions
and formally prove the density mode isolation bias in kernel K-means for a
common class of kernels. We call it Breiman's bias due to its similarity to the
histogram mode isolation previously discovered by Breiman in decision tree
learning with Gini impurity. We also extend our analysis to other popular
kernel clustering methods, e.g. average/normalized cut or dominant sets, where
density biases can take different forms. For example, splitting isolated points
by cut-based criteria is essentially the sparsest subset bias, which is the
opposite of the density mode bias. Our findings suggest that a principled
solution for density biases in kernel clustering should directly address data
inhomogeneity. We show that density equalization can be implicitly achieved
using either locally adaptive weights or locally adaptive kernels. Moreover,
density equalization makes many popular kernel clustering objectives
equivalent. Our synthetic and real data experiments illustrate density biases
and proposed solutions. We anticipate that theoretical understanding of kernel

vibrational anharmonic and dynamical effects -- typically neglected by
conventional quantum chemistry approaches -- we base our machine learning
strategy on ab initio molecular dynamics simulations. While these simulations
are usually extremely time consuming even for small molecules, we overcome
these limitations by leveraging the power of a variety of machine learning
techniques, not only accelerating simulations by several orders of magnitude,
but also greatly extending the size of systems that can be treated. To this
end, we develop a molecular dipole moment model based on environment dependent
neural network charges and combine it with the neural network potentials of
Behler and Parrinello. Contrary to the prevalent big data philosophy, we are
able to obtain very accurate machine learning models for the prediction of
infrared spectra based on only a few hundreds of electronic structure reference
points. This is made possible through the introduction of a fully automated

training. We demonstrate the power of our machine learning approach by applying
it to model the infrared spectra of a methanol molecule, n-alkanes containing

http://arxiv.org/abs/1705.05491v2,Distributed Statistical Machine Learning in Adversarial Settings: Byzantine Gradient Descent,"We consider the problem of distributed statistical machine learning in
adversarial settings, where some unknown and time-varying subset of working
machines may be compromised and behave arbitrarily to prevent an accurate model
from being learned. This setting captures the potential adversarial attacks
faced by Federated Learning -- a modern machine learning paradigm that is
proposed by Google researchers and has been intensively studied for ensuring
user privacy. Formally, we focus on a distributed system consisting of a
parameter server and $m$ working machines. Each working machine keeps $N/m$
data samples, where $N$ is the total number of samples. The goal is to
collectively learn the underlying true model parameter of dimension $d$.
  In classical batch gradient descent methods, the gradients reported to the
server by the working machines are aggregated via simple averaging, which is
vulnerable to a single Byzantine failure. In this paper, we propose a Byzantine
gradient descent method based on the geometric median of means of the
gradients. We show that our method can tolerate $q \le (m-1)/2$ Byzantine
failures, and the parameter estimate converges in $O(\log N)$ rounds with an
estimation error of $\sqrt{d(2q+1)/N}$, hence approaching the optimal error
rate $\sqrt{d/N}$ in the centralized and failure-free setting. The total
computational complexity of our algorithm is of $O((Nd/m) \log N)$ at each
working machine and $O(md + kd \log^3 N)$ at the central server, and the total
communication cost is of $O(m d \log N)$. We further provide an application of
our general results to the linear regression problem.
  A key challenge arises in the above problem is that Byzantine failures create
arbitrary and unspecified dependency among the iterations and the aggregated
gradients. We prove that the aggregated gradient converges uniformly to the
true gradient function.","['Yudong Chen', 'Lili Su', 'Jiaming Xu']","['cs.DC', 'cs.CR', 'cs.LG', 'stat.ML']",2017-05-16 00:20:49+00:00

pseudo-likelihood method for which the couplings are inferred independently for

compute the reconstruction error of the couplings using a combination of the
replica method with the cavity approach for densely connected systems. We show
that an explicit estimator based on a quadratic cost function achieves minimal
reconstruction error, but requires the length of the true coupling vector as
prior knowledge. A simple mean field estimator of the couplings which does not
need such knowledge is asymptotically optimal, i.e. when the number of
observations is much large than the number of spins. Comparison of the theory

intrinsic reward signal to enable the agent to explore its environment and
learn skills that might be useful later in its life. We formulate curiosity as
the error in an agent's ability to predict the consequence of its own actions

Our formulation scales to high-dimensional continuous state spaces like images,
bypasses the difficulties of directly predicting pixels, and, critically,
ignores the aspects of the environment that cannot affect the agent. The
proposed approach is evaluated in two environments: VizDoom and Super Mario
Bros. Three broad settings are investigated: 1) sparse extrinsic reward, where
curiosity allows for far fewer interactions with the environment to reach the
goal; 2) exploration with no extrinsic reward, where curiosity pushes the agent
to explore more efficiently; and 3) generalization to unseen scenarios (e.g.
new levels of the same game) where the knowledge gained from earlier experience
helps the agent explore new places much faster than starting from scratch. Demo
