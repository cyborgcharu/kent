learning (RL): obtaining sample-efficiency guarantees with a dataset lacking
sufficient coverage, under only realizability-type assumptions for the function
approximators. While the existing theory has addressed learning under
realizability and under non-exploratory data separately, no work has been able
to address both simultaneously (except for a concurrent work which we compare
in detail). Under an additional gap assumption, we provide guarantees to a
simple pessimistic algorithm based on a version space formed by marginalized
importance sampling (MIS), and the guarantee only requires the data to cover
the optimal policy and the function classes to realize the optimal value and
density-ratio functions. While similar gap assumptions have been used in other
areas of RL theory, our work is the first to identify the utility and the novel
mechanism of gap assumptions in offline RL with weak function approximation.","['Jinglin Chen', 'Nan Jiang']","['cs.LG', 'stat.ML']",2022-03-25 23:33:38+00:00

approximating permutation-equivariant functions over graphs or general
relational data, more expressive, higher-order graph neural networks do not
scale to large graphs. They either operate on $k$-order tensors or consider all
$k$-node subgraphs, implying an exponential dependence on $k$ in memory
requirements, and do not adapt to the sparsity of the graph. By introducing new
heuristics for the graph isomorphism problem, we devise a class of universal,
permutation-equivariant graph networks, which, unlike previous architectures,
offer a fine-grained control between expressivity and scalability and adapt to
the sparsity of the graph. These architectures lead to vastly reduced
computation times compared to standard higher-order graph networks in the
supervised node- and graph-level classification and regression regime while
significantly improving over standard graph neural network and graph kernel
architectures in terms of predictive performance.","['Christopher Morris', 'Gaurav Rattan', 'Sandra Kiefer', 'Siamak Ravanbakhsh']","['cs.LG', 'cs.AI', 'cs.DS', 'cs.NE', 'stat.ML']",2022-03-25 21:17:09+00:00

reduction and manifold learning method. It has two main steps which are linear
reconstruction and linear embedding of points in the input space and embedding
space, respectively. In this work, we look at the linear reconstruction step
from a stochastic perspective where it is assumed that every data point is
conditioned on its linear reconstruction weights as latent factors. The
stochastic linear reconstruction of LLE is solved using expectation
maximization. We show that there is a theoretical connection between three
fundamental dimensionality reduction methods, i.e., LLE, factor analysis, and
probabilistic Principal Component Analysis (PCA). The stochastic linear
reconstruction of LLE is formulated similar to the factor analysis and
probabilistic PCA. It is also explained why factor analysis and probabilistic
PCA are linear and LLE is a nonlinear method. This work combines and makes a
bridge between two broad approaches of dimensionality reduction, i.e., the
spectral and probabilistic algorithms.","['Benyamin Ghojogh', 'Ali Ghodsi', 'Fakhri Karray', 'Mark Crowley']","['stat.ML', 'cs.LG']",2022-03-25 21:07:20+00:00

potential impact on the safety, security, and fairness of
human-machine-systems. Such require basic understanding and sufficient trust by
the users. This motivated the research field of explainable artificial
intelligence (XAI), i.e. finding methods for opening the ""black-boxes"" DNNs
represent. For the computer vision domain in specific, practical assessment of
DNNs requires a globally valid association of human interpretable concepts with
internals of the model. The research field of concept (embedding) analysis (CA)
tackles this problem: CA aims to find global, assessable associations of
humanly interpretable semantic concepts (e.g., eye, bearded) with internal
representations of a DNN. This work establishes a general definition of CA and
a taxonomy for CA methods, uniting several ideas from literature. That allows
to easily position and compare CA approaches. Guided by the defined notions,
the current state-of-the-art research regarding CA methods and interesting
applications are reviewed. More than thirty relevant methods are discussed,
compared, and categorized. Finally, for practitioners, a survey of fifteen
datasets is provided that have been used for supervised concept analysis. Open
challenges and research directions are pointed out at the end.",['Gesina Schwalbe'],"['cs.LG', 'cs.AI', 'cs.CV', 'stat.ML', 'I.2.4; I.2.6; I.2.10; I.2.m']",2022-03-25 20:57:16+00:00

treatment regime and more generally to nested functionals. We show that the
multiply robust formula for the dynamic treatment regime with discrete
treatments can be re-stated in terms of a recursive Riesz representer
characterization of nested mean regressions. We then apply a recursive Riesz
representer estimation learning algorithm that estimates de-biasing corrections
without the need to characterize how the correction terms look like, such as
for instance, products of inverse probability weighting terms, as is done in
prior work on doubly robust estimation in the dynamic regime. Our approach
defines a sequence of loss minimization problems, whose minimizers are the
mulitpliers of the de-biasing correction, hence circumventing the need for
solving auxiliary propensity models and directly optimizing for the mean
squared error of the target de-biasing correction. We provide further
applications of our approach to estimation of dynamic discrete choice models
and estimation of long-term effects with surrogates.","['Victor Chernozhukov', 'Whitney Newey', 'Rahul Singh', 'Vasilis Syrgkanis']","['econ.EM', 'cs.LG', 'math.ST', 'stat.ML', 'stat.TH']",2022-03-25 19:54:17+00:00

hybrid model that effectively mitigates, via an end-to-end architecture, the
need for hand-designed features and manual model selection issues of
conventional nonlinear prediction/regression methods. In particular, we use
recursive structures to extract features from sequential signals, while
preserving the state information, i.e., the history, and boosted decision trees
to produce the final output. The connection is in an end-to-end fashion and we
jointly optimize the whole architecture using stochastic gradient descent, for
which we also provide the backward pass update equations. In particular, we
employ a recurrent neural network (LSTM) for adaptive feature extraction from
sequential data and a gradient boosting machinery (soft GBDT) for effective
supervised regression. Our framework is generic so that one can use other deep
learning architectures for feature extraction (such as RNNs and GRUs) and
machine learning algorithms for decision making as long as they are
differentiable. We demonstrate the learning behavior of our algorithm on
synthetic data and the significant performance improvements over the
conventional methods over various real life datasets. Furthermore, we openly

http://arxiv.org/abs/2203.13779v2,Origins of Low-dimensional Adversarial Perturbations,"In this paper, we initiate a rigorous study of the phenomenon of
low-dimensional adversarial perturbations (LDAPs) in classification. Unlike the
classical setting, these perturbations are limited to a subspace of dimension
$k$ which is much smaller than the dimension $d$ of the feature space. The case
$k=1$ corresponds to so-called universal adversarial perturbations (UAPs;
Moosavi-Dezfooli et al., 2017). First, we consider binary classifiers under
generic regularity conditions (including ReLU networks) and compute analytical
lower-bounds for the fooling rate of any subspace. These bounds explicitly
highlight the dependence of the fooling rate on the pointwise margin of the
model (i.e., the ratio of the output to its $L_2$ norm of its gradient at a
test point), and on the alignment of the given subspace with the gradients of
the model w.r.t. inputs. Our results provide a rigorous explanation for the
recent success of heuristic methods for efficiently generating low-dimensional
adversarial perturbations. Finally, we show that if a decision-region is
compact, then it admits a universal adversarial perturbation with $L_2$ norm
which is $\sqrt{d}$ times smaller than the typical $L_2$ norm of a data point.
Our theoretical results are confirmed by experiments on both synthetic and real
data.","['Elvis Dohmatob', 'Chuan Guo', 'Morgane Goibert']","['stat.ML', 'cs.LG']",2022-03-25 17:02:49+00:00

data when the number of clusters is unknown. One main DPGMM inference paradigm
relies on sampling. Here we consider a known state-of-art sampler (proposed by
Chang and Fisher III (2013) and improved by Dinari et al. (2019)), analyze its
failure modes, and show how to improve it, often drastically. Concretely, in
that sampler, whenever a new cluster is formed it is augmented with two
subclusters whose labels are initialized at random. Upon their evolution, the
subclusters serve to propose a split of the parent cluster. We show that the
random initialization is often problematic and hurts the otherwise-effective
sampler. Specifically, we demonstrate that this initialization tends to lead to
poor split proposals and/or too many iterations before a desired split is
accepted. This slows convergence and can damage the clustering. As a remedy, we
propose two drop-in-replacement options for the subcluster-initialization
subroutine. The first is an intuitive heuristic while the second is based on
deep learning. We show that the proposed approach yields better splits, which
in turn translate to substantial improvements in performance, results, and
stability.","['Vlad Winter', 'Or Dinari', 'Oren Freifeld']","['cs.LG', 'stat.ML']",2022-03-25 14:12:33+00:00

proposed embedding methods under one umbrella. PELP generalises graph-enhanced,
group, dynamic, and cross-lingual static word embeddings. PELP also enables any
combination of these previous models in a straightforward fashion. Furthermore,
we empirically show that our model matches the performance of previous models

systems whose outputs may be the result of many correlated inputs. Hence,
severe ill-conditioning may affect the estimation problem. This is a scenario
often arising when modeling complex physical systems given by the
interconnection of many sub-units where feedback and algebraic loops can be
encountered. We develop a strategy based on Bayesian regularization where any
impulse response is modeled as the realization of a zero-mean Gaussian process.
The stable spline covariance is used to include information on smooth
exponential decay of the impulse responses. We then design a new Markov chain
Monte Carlo scheme that deals with collinearity and is able to efficiently
reconstruct the posterior of the impulse responses. It is based on a variation
of Gibbs sampling which updates possibly overlapping blocks of the parameter
space on the basis of the level of collinearity affecting the different inputs.
Numerical experiments are included to test the goodness of the approach where
hundreds of impulse responses form the system and inputs correlation may be
very high.","['Wenqi Cao', 'Gianluigi Pillonetto']","['math.DS', 'cs.SY', 'eess.SY', 'stat.ML']",2022-03-25 13:11:26+00:00

replacing its link function, the standard normal cdf, by a $p$-generalized

distributions \citep{Sub23} are of special interest in statistical modeling
because they fit much more flexibly to data. Their tail behavior can be
controlled by choice of the parameter $p$, which influences the model's
sensitivity to outliers. Special cases include the Laplace, the Gaussian, and
the uniform distributions. We further show how the maximum likelihood estimator
for $p$-generalized probit regression can be approximated efficiently up to a
factor of $(1+\varepsilon)$ on large data by combining sketching techniques
with importance subsampling to obtain a small data summary called coreset.","['Alexander Munteanu', 'Simon Omlor', 'Christian Peters']","['cs.DS', 'cs.LG', 'stat.ML']",2022-03-25 10:54:41+00:00

continuous time stochastic processes. It describes whether the evolution of one
process is directly influenced by another process given the histories of
additional processes, and it is important for the description and learning of
causal relations among processes. We develop a model-free framework for testing
the hypothesis that a counting process is conditionally locally independent of
another process. To this end, we introduce a new functional parameter called
the Local Covariance Measure (LCM), which quantifies deviations from the
hypothesis. Following the principles of double machine learning, we propose an
estimator of the LCM and a test of the hypothesis using nonparametric
estimators and sample splitting or cross-fitting. We call this test the
(cross-fitted) Local Covariance Test ((X)-LCT), and we show that its level and
power can be controlled uniformly, provided that the nonparametric estimators
are consistent with modest rates. We illustrate the theory by an example based
on a marginalized Cox model with time-dependent covariates, and we show in
simulations that when double machine learning is used in combination with
cross-fitting, then the test works well without restrictive parametric
assumptions.","['Alexander Mangulad Christgau', 'Lasse Petersen', 'Niels Richard Hansen']","['math.ST', 'stat.ML', 'stat.TH', '62G10, 62G20']",2022-03-25 10:31:02+00:00

large-scale self-supervised learning. However, theoretical understanding of how
it works is still unclear. In this paper, we propose a new guarantee on the
downstream performance without resorting to the conditional independence
assumption that is widely adopted in previous work but hardly holds in
practice. Our new theory hinges on the insight that the support of different
intra-class samples will become more overlapped under aggressive data
augmentations, thus simply aligning the positive samples (augmented views of
the same sample) could make contrastive learning cluster intra-class samples
together. Based on this augmentation overlap perspective, theoretically, we
obtain asymptotically closed bounds for downstream performance under weaker
assumptions, and empirically, we propose an unsupervised model selection metric
ARC that aligns well with downstream accuracy. Our theory suggests an
alternative understanding of contrastive learning: the role of aligning
positive samples is more like a surrogate task than an ultimate goal, and the
overlapped augmented views (i.e., the chaos) create a ladder for contrastive
learning to gradually learn class-separated representations. The code for
computing ARC is available at https://github.com/zhangq327/ARC.","['Yifei Wang', 'Qi Zhang', 'Yisen Wang', 'Jiansheng Yang', 'Zhouchen Lin']","['cs.LG', 'cs.CV', 'stat.ML']",2022-03-25 05:36:26+00:00

models with AT have good generative ability and can synthesize realistic

demystify this phenomenon by developing a unified probabilistic framework,

first probabilistic characterization of AT through a unified understanding of
robustness and generative ability. On the other hand, our unified framework can
be extended to the unsupervised scenario, which interprets unsupervised
contrastive learning as an important sampling of CEM. Based on these, we
propose a principled method to develop adversarial learning and sampling
methods. Experiments show that the sampling methods derived from our framework
improve the sample quality in both supervised and unsupervised learning.
Notably, our unsupervised adversarial sampling method achieves an Inception

bandits, the policy of the recommender system influences the rewards accrued,
but not the length of interaction. However, in real-world systems, dissatisfied
users may depart (and never come back). In this work, we propose a novel
multi-armed bandit setup that captures such policy-dependent horizons. Our
setup consists of a finite set of user types, and multiple arms with Bernoulli
payoffs. Each (user type, arm) tuple corresponds to an (unknown) reward
probability. Each user's type is initially unknown and can only be inferred
through their response to recommendations. Moreover, if a user is dissatisfied
with their recommendation, they might depart the system. We first address the
case where all users share the same type, demonstrating that a recent UCB-based
algorithm is optimal. We then move forward to the more challenging case, where
users are divided among two types. While naive approaches cannot handle this

computing the distance between two mini-batch probability measures is repeated

optimization and sliced Wasserstein generative models. In particular, we derive

parameters of a population distribution, when a statistic of a sample from that
population is shared in noise to provide differential privacy.
  This work mainly addresses two problems: (1) What statistic of the sample
should be shared privately? For the first question, i.e., the one about
statistic selection, we promote using the Fisher information. We find out that,
the statistic that is most informative in a non-privacy setting may not be the
optimal choice under the privacy restrictions. We provide several examples to
support that point. We consider several types of data sharing settings and
propose several Monte Carlo-based numerical estimation methods for calculating
the Fisher information for those settings. The second question concerns
inference: (2) Based on the shared statistics, how could we perform effective
Bayesian inference? We propose several Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)
algorithms for sampling from the posterior distribution of the parameter given
the noisy statistic. The proposed MCMC algorithms can be preferred over one
another depending on the problem. For example, when the shared statistics is
additive and added Gaussian noise, a simple Metropolis-Hasting algorithm that
utilizes the central limit theorem is a decent choice. We propose more advanced
MCMC algorithms for several other cases of practical relevance.
  Our numerical examples involve comparing several candidate statistics to be
shared privately. For each statistic, we perform Bayesian estimation based on
the posterior distribution conditional on the privatized version of that
statistic. We demonstrate that, the relative performance of a statistic, in
terms of the mean squared error of the Bayesian estimator based on the
corresponding privatized statistic, is adequately predicted by the Fisher
information of the privatized statistic.","['Baris Alparslan', 'Sinan Yildirim']","['stat.ME', 'cs.LG', 'stat.CO', 'stat.ML']",2022-03-24 22:57:37+00:00

treatment effects, leading to poor calibration of the resulting models.
However, while many methods exist for evaluating the calibration of prediction

propose a robust estimator. Our approach is motivated by doubly robust
treatment effect estimators, making it unbiased, and resilient to confounding,
overfitting, and high-dimensionality issues. Furthermore, our method is
straightforward to adapt to many structures under which treatment effects can

label sources -- pre-trained models, heuristics, crowd-workers -- to construct
pseudolabels. The challenge is building a combination that best exploits the
signal available in both foundation models and weak sources. We propose Liger,

elements of existing weak supervision techniques. First, we produce finer
estimates of weak source quality by partitioning the embedding space and
learning per-part source accuracies. Second, we improve source coverage by
extending source votes in embedding space. Despite the black-box nature of
foundation models, we prove results characterizing how our approach improves

themselves to be a powerful tool in all facets of society. However, due to
budget limitations, deliberate or non-deliberate censorship, and other problems
during data collection and curation, the labeled training set might exhibit a
systematic shortage of data for certain groups. We investigate a scenario in
which the absence of certain data is linked to the second level of a two-level
hierarchy in the data. Inspired by the idea of protected groups from
algorithmic fairness, we refer to the partitions carved by this second level as
""subgroups""; we refer to combinations of subgroups and classes, or leaves of
the hierarchy, as ""sources"". To characterize the problem, we introduce the
concept of classes with incomplete subgroup support. The representational bias
in the training set can give rise to spurious correlations between the classes
and the subgroups which render standard classification models ungeneralizable
to unseen sources. To overcome this bias, we make use of an additional, diverse
but unlabeled dataset, called the ""deployment set"", to learn a representation
that is invariant to subgroup. This is done by adversarially matching the
support of the training and deployment sets in representation space. In order
to learn the desired invariance, it is paramount that the sets of samples
observed by the discriminator are balanced by class; this is easily achieved
for the training set, but requires using semi-supervised clustering for the
deployment set. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method with experiments
on several datasets and variants of the problem.","['Thomas Kehrenberg', 'Myles Bartlett', 'Viktoriia Sharmanska', 'Novi Quadrianto']","['stat.ML', 'cs.LG']",2022-03-24 16:19:19+00:00

pre-training requires high computational resources and introduces many

We propose a multi-armed bandit framework for the sequential selection of TLM
pre-training hyperparameters, aimed at optimizing language model performance,
in a resource efficient manner. We design a Thompson sampling algorithm, with a
surrogate Gaussian process reward model of the Masked Language Model (MLM)
pre-training objective, for its sequential minimization. Instead of MLM
pre-training with fixed masking probabilities, the proposed Gaussian
process-based Thompson sampling (GP-TS) accelerates pre-training by
sequentially selecting masking hyperparameters that improve performance. We
empirically demonstrate how GP-TS pre-trains language models efficiently, i.e.,
it achieves lower MLM loss in fewer epochs, across a variety of settings. In
addition, GP-TS pre-trained TLMs attain competitive downstream performance,
while avoiding expensive hyperparameter grid search. GP-TS provides an
interactive framework for efficient and optimized TLM pre-training that, by
circumventing costly hyperparameter selection, enables substantial

well they perform. Without this frame of reference, the performance score of a
model is basically meaningless. What does it mean when a model achieves an
$F_1$ of 0.8 on a test set? A proper baseline is needed to evaluate the
`goodness' of a performance score. Comparing with the latest state-of-the-art
model is usually insightful. However, being state-of-the-art can change rapidly
when newer models are developed. Contrary to an advanced model, a simple dummy
classifier could be used. However, the latter could be beaten too easily,
making the comparison less valuable. This paper presents a universal baseline
method for all binary classification models, named the Dutch Draw (DD). This
approach weighs simple classifiers and determines the best classifier to use as
a baseline. We theoretically derive the DD baseline for many commonly used
evaluation measures and show that in most situations it reduces to (almost)
always predicting either zero or one. Summarizing, the DD baseline is: (1)
general, as it is applicable to all binary classification problems; (2) simple,
as it is quickly determined without training or parameter-tuning; (3)
informative, as insightful conclusions can be drawn from the results. The DD
baseline serves two purposes. First, to enable comparisons across research
papers by this robust and universal baseline. Secondly, to provide a sanity
check during the development process of a prediction model. It is a major

ever more crucial for society as climate change increases the frequency of such
extremes. Global numerical weather prediction models often fail to capture
extremes, and are produced at too low a resolution to be actionable, while
regional, high-resolution models are hugely expensive both in computation and
labour. In this paper we explore the use of deep generative models to
simultaneously correct and downscale (super-resolve) global ensemble forecasts
over the Continental US. Specifically, using fine-grained radar observations as
our ground truth, we train a conditional Generative Adversarial Network --
coined CorrectorGAN -- via a custom training procedure and augmented loss
function, to produce ensembles of high-resolution, bias-corrected forecasts
based on coarse, global precipitation forecasts in addition to other relevant
meteorological fields. Our model outperforms an interpolation baseline, as well
as super-resolution-only and CNN-based univariate methods, and approaches the
performance of an operational regional high-resolution model across an array of
established probabilistic metrics. Crucially, CorrectorGAN, once trained,
produces predictions in seconds on a single machine. These results raise
exciting questions about the necessity of regional models, and whether
data-driven downscaling and correction methods can be transferred to data-poor
regions that so far have had no access to high-resolution forecasts.","['Ilan Price', 'Stephan Rasp']","['stat.ML', 'cs.LG', 'stat.AP']",2022-03-23 09:45:12+00:00

data samples from multiple possibly heterogeneous sources has become
increasingly prevalent. On the other hand, in distributionally robust
optimization, we seek data-driven decisions which perform well under the most
adverse distribution from a nominal distribution constructed from data samples
within a certain discrepancy of probability distributions. However, it remains
unclear how to achieve such distributional robustness in model learning and
estimation when data samples from multiple sources are available. In this work,
we propose constructing the nominal distribution in optimal transport-based
distributionally robust optimization problems through the notion of Wasserstein
barycenter as an aggregation of data samples from multiple sources. Under
specific choices of the loss function, the proposed formulation admits a
tractable reformulation as a finite convex program, with powerful finite-sample

accuracies of the weak supervision sources, improving the estimate of
unobserved labels. It is the first approach to enable data augmentation through
weakly supervised synthetic images and pseudolabels. Additionally, its learned

what makes two units functionally similar. For this, we consider two broad
families of methods: those that define similarity based on how units respond to
structured variations in inputs (""upstream""), and those based on how variations
in hidden unit activations affect outputs (""downstream""). We conduct an
empirical study quantifying modularity of hidden layer representations of

hidden units in each layer using a variety of both upstream and downstream
measures, then cluster them by maximizing their ""modularity score"" using

dropout dramatically increased modularity, while other forms of weight
regularization had more modest effects. Second, although we observe that there

downstream methods, there is little agreement about the cluster assignments

concept of random view groups is presented to capture the versatile view-wise
relationships, through which the hybrid early-late fusion strategy is designed

that performs well on out-of-distribution (OOD) data. Recently, causality has
become a powerful tool to tackle the OOD generalization problem, with the idea
resting on the causal mechanism that is invariant across domains of interest.
To leverage the generally unknown causal mechanism, existing works assume a
linear form of causal feature or require sufficiently many and diverse training
domains, which are usually restrictive in practice. In this work, we obviate
these assumptions and tackle the OOD problem without explicitly recovering the
causal feature. Our approach is based on transformations that modify the
non-causal feature but leave the causal part unchanged, which can be either
obtained from prior knowledge or learned from the training data in the
multi-domain scenario. Under the setting of invariant causal mechanism, we
theoretically show that if all such transformations are available, then we can
learn a minimax optimal model across the domains using only single domain data.
Noticing that knowing a complete set of these causal invariant transformations
may be impractical, we further show that it suffices to know only a subset of
these transformations. Based on the theoretical findings, a regularized
training procedure is proposed to improve the OOD generalization capability.

fine-tuned by retraining on subsequently gathered data, adding newly discovered
features, or more. Each modification introduces a risk of deteriorating
performance and must be validated on a test dataset. It may not always be
practical to assemble a new dataset for testing each modification, especially
when most modifications are minor or are implemented in rapid succession.
Recent works have shown how one can repeatedly test modifications on the same
dataset and protect against overfitting by (i) discretizing test results along
a grid and (ii) applying a Bonferroni correction to adjust for the total number
of modifications considered by an adaptive developer. However, the standard
Bonferroni correction is overly conservative when most modifications are
beneficial and/or highly correlated. This work investigates more powerful
approaches using alpha-recycling and sequentially-rejective graphical
procedures (SRGPs). We introduce novel extensions that account for correlation
between adaptively chosen algorithmic modifications. In empirical analyses, the
SRGPs control the error rate of approving unacceptable modifications and
approve a substantially higher number of beneficial modifications than previous
approaches.","['Jean Feng', 'Gene Pennello', 'Nicholas Petrick', 'Berkman Sahiner', 'Romain Pirracchio', 'Alexej Gossmann']","['stat.ML', 'cs.LG', 'stat.ME']",2022-03-21 22:43:40+00:00

are the tools at their disposal to construct the target? For classification
tasks, the network must transform the data classes into a linearly separable
representation in the final hidden layer. We show that a feed-forward
architecture has one primary tool at hand to achieve this separability:
progressive folding of the data manifold in unoccupied higher dimensions. The
operation of folding provides a useful intuition in low-dimensions that
generalizes to high ones. We argue that an alternative method based on shear,
requiring very deep architectures, plays only a small role in real-world
networks. The folding operation, however, is powerful as long as layers are
wider than the data dimensionality, allowing efficient solutions by providing
access to arbitrary regions in the distribution, such as data points of one
class forming islands within the other classes. We argue that a link exists
between the universal approximation property in ReLU networks and the
fold-and-cut theorem (Demaine et al., 1998) dealing with physical paper
folding. Based on the mechanistic insight, we predict that the progressive
generation of separability is necessarily accompanied by neurons showing mixed
selectivity and bimodal tuning curves. This is validated in a network trained
on the poker hand task, showing the emergence of bimodal tuning curves during
training. We hope that our intuitive picture of the data transformation in deep
networks can help to provide interpretability, and discuss possible
applications to the theory of convolutional networks, loss landscapes, and
generalization.

in practice, but they are in general unable to provide helpful explanations for
the predictions they make. In this work we propose a model-agnostic algorithm
that generates counterfactual ensemble explanations for time series anomaly
detection models. Our method generates a set of diverse counterfactual
examples, i.e, multiple perturbed versions of the original time series that are
not considered anomalous by the detection model. Since the magnitude of the
perturbations is limited, these counterfactuals represent an ensemble of inputs
similar to the original time series that the model would deem normal. Our
algorithm is applicable to any differentiable anomaly detection model. We
investigate the value of our method on univariate and multivariate real-world
datasets and two deep-learning-based anomaly detection models, under several
explainability criteria previously proposed in other data domains such as
Validity, Plausibility, Closeness and Diversity. We show that our algorithm can
produce ensembles of counterfactual examples that satisfy these criteria and
thanks to a novel type of visualisation, can convey a richer interpretation of
a model's internal mechanism than existing methods. Moreover, we design a
sparse variant of our method to improve the interpretability of counterfactual

many-dimensional probability distributions that appear e.g. in lattice field
theories or statistical mechanics. Subsequently they can be used as variational
approximators to asses extensive properties of statistical systems, like free
energy, and also as neural samplers used in Monte Carlo simulations. The
practical application of this approach is unfortunately limited by its
unfavorable scaling both of the numerical cost required for training, and the
memory requirements with the system size. This is due to the fact that the
original proposition involved a neural network of width which scaled with the
total number of degrees of freedom, e.g. $L^2$ in case of a two dimensional
$L\times L$ lattice. In this work we propose a hierarchical association of
physical degrees of freedom, for instance spins, to neurons which replaces it
with the scaling with the linear extent $L$ of the system. We demonstrate our
approach on the two-dimensional Ising model by simulating lattices of various
sizes up to $128 \times 128$ spins, with time benchmarks reaching lattices of
size $512 \times 512$. We observe that our proposal improves the quality of
neural network training, i.e. the approximated probability distribution is
closer to the target that could be previously achieved. As a consequence, the
variational free energy reaches a value closer to its theoretical expectation
and, if applied in a Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithm, the resulting
autocorrelation time is smaller. Finally, the replacement of a single neural
network by a hierarchy of smaller networks considerably reduces the memory
requirements.","['Piotr Białas', 'Piotr Korcyl', 'Tomasz Stebel']","['cond-mat.stat-mech', 'cs.LG', 'hep-lat', 'stat.ML']",2022-03-21 13:55:53+00:00

and machine learning methods to directly estimate the heterogeneous treatment
effects, which has been widely applied to various online marketplaces to assist
large-scale decision-making in recent years. The existing popular models, like
causal forest (CF), are limited to either discrete treatments or posing
parametric assumptions on the outcome-treatment relationship that may suffer
model misspecification. However, continuous treatments (e.g., price, duration)
often arise in marketplaces. To alleviate these restrictions, we use a
kernel-based doubly robust estimator to recover the non-parametric
dose-response functions that can flexibly model continuous treatment effects.
Moreover, we propose a generic distance-based splitting criterion to capture
the heterogeneity for the continuous treatments. We call the proposed algorithm
generalized causal forest (GCF) as it generalizes the use case of CF to a much
broader setting. We show the effectiveness of GCF by deriving the asymptotic
property of the estimator and comparing it to popular uplift modeling methods
on both synthetic and real-world datasets. We implement GCF on Spark and

strong norm distances on parameter spaces of functions. Critical to our
approach is the combination of a local Lipschitz-continuity for the posterior
distribution with a dynamic formulation of the Wasserstein distance, which
allows to set forth an interesting connection between PCRs and some classical
problems arising in mathematical analysis, probability and statistics, e.g.,
Laplace methods for approximating integrals, Sanov's large deviation principles
in the Wasserstein distance, rates of convergence of mean Glivenko-Cantelli

present a theorem on PCRs for a model in the regular infinite-dimensional

extend such a theorem to a general dominated model. These results rely on the
development of novel techniques to evaluate Laplace integrals and weighted

neural network models with a large number of weights (parameters), many
solutions can be found to fit the training data equally well. The key question
is which solution can describe testing data not in the training set. Here, we
report the discovery of an exact duality (equivalence) between changes in
activities in a given layer of neurons and changes in weights that connect to
the next layer of neurons in a densely connected layer in any feed forward
neural network. The activity-weight (A-W) duality allows us to map variations
in inputs (data) to variations of the corresponding dual weights. By using this
mapping, we show that the generalization loss can be decomposed into a sum of
contributions from different eigen-directions of the Hessian matrix of the loss
function at the solution in weight space. The contribution from a given
eigen-direction is the product of two geometric factors (determinants): the
sharpness of the loss landscape and the standard deviation of the dual weights,
which is found to scale with the weight norm of the solution. Our results
provide an unified framework, which we used to reveal how different
regularization schemes (weight decay, stochastic gradient descent with
different batch sizes and learning rates, dropout), training data size, and
labeling noise affect generalization performance by controlling either one or
both of these two geometric determinants for generalization. These insights can

http://arxiv.org/abs/2203.10262v2,Perturbation Analysis of Randomized SVD and its Applications to High-dimensional Statistics,"Randomized singular value decomposition (RSVD) is a class of computationally
efficient algorithms for computing the truncated SVD of large data matrices.
Given a $n \times n$ symmetric matrix $\mathbf{M}$, the prototypical RSVD
algorithm outputs an approximation of the $k$ leading singular vectors of
$\mathbf{M}$ by computing the SVD of $\mathbf{M}^{g} \mathbf{G}$; here $g \geq
1$ is an integer and $\mathbf{G} \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times k}$ is a random
Gaussian sketching matrix. In this paper we study the statistical properties of
RSVD under a general ""signal-plus-noise"" framework, i.e., the observed matrix
$\hat{\mathbf{M}}$ is assumed to be an additive perturbation of some true but
unknown signal matrix $\mathbf{M}$. We first derive upper bounds for the
$\ell_2$ (spectral norm) and $\ell_{2\to\infty}$ (maximum row-wise $\ell_2$
norm) distances between the approximate singular vectors of $\hat{\mathbf{M}}$
and the true singular vectors of the signal matrix $\mathbf{M}$. These upper
bounds depend on the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and the number of power
iterations $g$. A phase transition phenomenon is observed in which a smaller
SNR requires larger values of $g$ to guarantee convergence of the $\ell_2$ and
$\ell_{2\to\infty}$ distances. We also show that the thresholds for $g$ where
these phase transitions occur are sharp whenever the noise matrices satisfy a
certain trace growth condition. Finally, we derive normal approximations for
the row-wise fluctuations of the approximate singular vectors and the entrywise
fluctuations of the approximate matrix. We illustrate our theoretical results
by deriving nearly-optimal performance guarantees for RSVD when applied to
three statistical inference problems, namely, community detection, matrix
completion, and principal component analysis with missing data.","['Yichi Zhang', 'Minh Tang']","['math.ST', 'cs.NA', 'math.NA', 'stat.CO', 'stat.ML', 'stat.TH']",2022-03-19 07:26:45+00:00
http://arxiv.org/abs/2203.10258v3,TDR-CL: Targeted Doubly Robust Collaborative Learning for Debiased Recommendations,"Bias is a common problem inherent in recommender systems, which is entangled
with users' preferences and poses a great challenge to unbiased learning. For
debiasing tasks, the doubly robust (DR) method and its variants show superior
performance due to the double robustness property, that is, DR is unbiased when
either imputed errors or learned propensities are accurate. However, our
theoretical analysis reveals that DR usually has a large variance. Meanwhile,
DR would suffer unexpectedly large bias and poor generalization caused by
inaccurate imputed errors and learned propensities, which usually occur in
practice. In this paper, we propose a principled approach that can effectively
reduce bias and variance simultaneously for existing DR approaches when the
error imputation model is misspecified. In addition, we further propose a novel
semi-parametric collaborative learning approach that decomposes imputed errors
into parametric and nonparametric parts and updates them collaboratively,
resulting in more accurate predictions. Both theoretical analysis and
experiments demonstrate the superiority of the proposed methods compared with
existing debiasing methods.","['Haoxuan Li', 'Yan Lyu', 'Chunyuan Zheng', 'Peng Wu']","['cs.IR', 'cs.LG', 'stat.ML']",2022-03-19 06:48:50+00:00
http://arxiv.org/abs/2203.10215v3,Convergence Error Analysis of Reflected Gradient Langevin Dynamics for Globally Optimizing Non-Convex Constrained Problems,"Gradient Langevin dynamics and a variety of its variants have attracted
increasing attention owing to their convergence towards the global optimal
solution, initially in the unconstrained convex framework while recently even
in convex constrained non-convex problems. In the present work, we extend those
frameworks to non-convex problems on a non-convex feasible region with a global
optimization algorithm built upon reflected gradient Langevin dynamics and
derive its convergence rates. By effectively making use of its reflection at
the boundary in combination with the probabilistic representation for the
Poisson equation with the Neumann boundary condition, we present promising
convergence rates, particularly faster than the existing one for convex
constrained non-convex problems.","['Kanji Sato', 'Akiko Takeda', 'Reiichiro Kawai', 'Taiji Suzuki']","['math.OC', 'math.PR', 'stat.ML']",2022-03-19 02:08:24+00:00

to realize the dynamic balance between exploration and exploitation. Thompson
Sampling is a common method for solving multi-armed bandit problem and has been
used to explore data that conform to various laws. In this paper, we consider
the Thompson Sampling approach for multi-armed bandit problem, in which rewards
conform to unknown asymmetric $\alpha$-stable distributions and explore their

latent variable models. Variants of the EM have been initially introduced,
using incremental updates to scale to large datasets, and using Monte Carlo
(MC) approximations to bypass the intractable conditional expectation of the
latent data for most nonconvex models. In this paper, we propose a general
class of methods called Two-Timescale EM Methods based on a two-stage approach
of stochastic updates to tackle an essential nonconvex optimization task for
latent variable models. We motivate the choice of a double dynamic by invoking
the variance reduction virtue of each stage of the method on both sources of
noise: the index sampling for the incremental update and the MC approximation.
We establish finite-time and global convergence bounds for nonconvex objective
functions. Numerical applications on various models such as deformable template
for image analysis or nonlinear models for pharmacokinetics are also presented
to illustrate our findings.","['Belhal Karimi', 'Ping Li']","['stat.ML', 'cs.LG']",2022-03-18 22:46:34+00:00

shifts. Understanding and overcoming these failures have led to a research
field of Out-of-Distribution (OOD) generalization. Despite being extensively
studied for static computer vision tasks, OOD generalization has been
underexplored for time series tasks. To shine light on this gap, we present
WOODS: eight challenging open-source time series benchmarks covering a diverse
range of data modalities, such as videos, brain recordings, and sensor signals.
We revise the existing OOD generalization algorithms for time series tasks and
evaluate them using our systematic framework. Our experiments show a large room

algorithms on our datasets, thus underscoring the new challenges posed by time
