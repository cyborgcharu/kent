http://arxiv.org/abs/1608.06622v2,The discriminative Kalman filter for nonlinear and non-Gaussian sequential Bayesian filtering,"The Kalman filter (KF) is used in a variety of applications for computing the
posterior distribution of latent states in a state space model. The model
requires a linear relationship between states and observations. Extensions to
the Kalman filter have been proposed that incorporate linear approximations to
nonlinear models, such as the extended Kalman filter (EKF) and the unscented
Kalman filter (UKF). However, we argue that in cases where the dimensionality
of observed variables greatly exceeds the dimensionality of state variables, a
model for $p(\text{state}|\text{observation})$ proves both easier to learn and
more accurate for latent space estimation. We derive and validate what we call
the discriminative Kalman filter (DKF): a closed-form discriminative version of
Bayesian filtering that readily incorporates off-the-shelf discriminative
learning techniques. Further, we demonstrate that given mild assumptions,
highly non-linear models for $p(\text{state}|\text{observation})$ can be
specified. We motivate and validate on synthetic datasets and in neural
decoding from non-human primates, showing substantial increases in decoding
performance versus the standard Kalman filter.","['Michael C. Burkhart', 'David M. Brandman', 'Carlos E. Vargas-Irwin', 'Matthew T. Harrison']",['stat.ML'],2016-08-23 19:53:20+00:00
http://arxiv.org/abs/1608.06582v2,Approximation and inference methods for stochastic biochemical kinetics - a tutorial review,"Stochastic fluctuations of molecule numbers are ubiquitous in biological
systems. Important examples include gene expression and enzymatic processes in
living cells. Such systems are typically modelled as chemical reaction networks
whose dynamics are governed by the Chemical Master Equation. Despite its simple
structure, no analytic solutions to the Chemical Master Equation are known for
most systems. Moreover, stochastic simulations are computationally expensive,
making systematic analysis and statistical inference a challenging task.
Consequently, significant effort has been spent in recent decades on the
development of efficient approximation and inference methods. This article
gives an introduction to basic modelling concepts as well as an overview of
state of the art methods. First, we motivate and introduce deterministic and
stochastic methods for modelling chemical networks, and give an overview of
simulation and exact solution methods. Next, we discuss several approximation
methods, including the chemical Langevin equation, the system size expansion,
moment closure approximations, time-scale separation approximations and hybrid
methods. We discuss their various properties and review recent advances and
remaining challenges for these methods. We present a comparison of several of
these methods by means of a numerical case study and highlight some of their
respective advantages and disadvantages. Finally, we discuss the problem of
inference from experimental data in the Bayesian framework and review recent
methods developed the literature. In summary, this review gives a
self-contained introduction to modelling, approximations and inference methods
for stochastic chemical kinetics.","['David Schnoerr', 'Guido Sanguinetti', 'Ramon Grima']","['q-bio.QM', 'cond-mat.stat-mech', 'physics.bio-ph', 'q-bio.MN', 'stat.ML']",2016-08-23 17:13:05+00:00

theoretical guarantees on the Leave-one-Out procedure applied to a broad class

notion of $L^q$ stability, and the strong use of moment inequalities. $L^q$
stability extends the ongoing notion of hypothesis stability while remaining
weaker than the uniform stability. It leads to new PAC exponential
generalisation bounds for Leave-one-Out under mild assumptions. In the

introduces a family of softplus function based regression models that convolve,
stack, or combine both operations by convolving countably infinite stacked
gamma distributions, whose scales depend on the covariates. Generalizing
logistic regression that uses a single hyperplane to partition the covariate
space into two halves, softplus regressions employ multiple hyperplanes to
construct a confined space, related to a single convex polytope defined by the
intersection of multiple half-spaces or a union of multiple convex polytopes,
to separate one class from the other. The gamma process is introduced to
support the convolution of countably infinite (stacked) covariate-dependent
gamma distributions. For Bayesian inference, Gibbs sampling derived via novel
data augmentation and marginalization techniques is used to deconvolve and/or
demix the highly complex nonlinear predictive distribution. Example results
demonstrate that softplus regressions provide flexible nonlinear decision
boundaries, achieving classification accuracies comparable to that of kernel
support vector machine while requiring significant less computation for

necessitating the development of efficient methods for evaluating these
rankers. Online ranker evaluation focuses on the challenge of efficiently
determining, from implicit user feedback, which ranker out of a finite set of
rankers is the best. Online ranker evaluation can be modeled by dueling ban-
dits, a mathematical model for online learning under limited feedback from
pairwise comparisons. Comparisons of pairs of rankers is performed by
interleaving their result sets and examining which documents users click on.
The dueling bandits model addresses the key issue of which pair of rankers to
compare at each iteration, thereby providing a solution to the
exploration-exploitation trade-off. Recently, methods for simultaneously
comparing more than two rankers have been developed. However, the question of
which rankers to compare at each iteration was left open. We address this
question by proposing a generalization of the dueling bandits model that uses
simultaneous comparisons of an unrestricted number of rankers. We evaluate our
algorithm on synthetic data and several standard large-scale online ranker
evaluation datasets. Our experimental results show that the algorithm yields
orders of magnitude improvement in performance compared to stateof- the-art

imprecision and the Cram\'{e}r-Rao lower bound with explicit dependence on the
feedback policy. We also explain the reinforcement learning approach for
generating quantum control policies, which is adopted due to the optimal policy

http://arxiv.org/abs/1608.06072v2,"Uniform Generalization, Concentration, and Adaptive Learning","One fundamental goal in any learning algorithm is to mitigate its risk for
overfitting. Mathematically, this requires that the learning algorithm enjoys a
small generalization risk, which is defined either in expectation or in
probability. Both types of generalization are commonly used in the literature.
For instance, generalization in expectation has been used to analyze
algorithms, such as ridge regression and SGD, whereas generalization in
probability is used in the VC theory, among others. Recently, a third notion of
generalization has been studied, called uniform generalization, which requires
that the generalization risk vanishes uniformly in expectation across all
bounded parametric losses. It has been shown that uniform generalization is, in
fact, equivalent to an information-theoretic stability constraint, and that it
recovers classical results in learning theory. It is achievable under various
settings, such as sample compression schemes, finite hypothesis spaces, finite
domains, and differential privacy. However, the relationship between uniform
generalization and concentration remained unknown. In this paper, we answer
this question by proving that, while a generalization in expectation does not
imply a generalization in probability, a uniform generalization in expectation
does imply concentration. We establish a chain rule for the uniform
generalization risk of the composition of hypotheses and use it to derive a
large deviation bound. Finally, we prove that the bound is tight.",['Ibrahim Alabdulmohsin'],"['cs.LG', 'cs.IT', 'math.IT', 'stat.ML', '68T05, 94A15', 'I.2.6']",2016-08-22 07:47:56+00:00

http://arxiv.org/abs/1608.06031v2,Towards Instance Optimal Bounds for Best Arm Identification,"In the classical best arm identification (Best-$1$-Arm) problem, we are given
$n$ stochastic bandit arms, each associated with a reward distribution with an
unknown mean. We would like to identify the arm with the largest mean with
probability at least $1-\delta$, using as few samples as possible.
Understanding the sample complexity of Best-$1$-Arm has attracted significant
attention since the last decade. However, the exact sample complexity of the
problem is still unknown.
  Recently, Chen and Li made the gap-entropy conjecture concerning the instance
sample complexity of Best-$1$-Arm. Given an instance $I$, let $\mu_{[i]}$ be
the $i$th largest mean and $\Delta_{[i]}=\mu_{[1]}-\mu_{[i]}$ be the
corresponding gap. $H(I)=\sum_{i=2}^n\Delta_{[i]}^{-2}$ is the complexity of
the instance. The gap-entropy conjecture states that
$\Omega\left(H(I)\cdot\left(\ln\delta^{-1}+\mathsf{Ent}(I)\right)\right)$ is an
instance lower bound, where $\mathsf{Ent}(I)$ is an entropy-like term
determined by the gaps, and there is a $\delta$-correct algorithm for
Best-$1$-Arm with sample complexity
$O\left(H(I)\cdot\left(\ln\delta^{-1}+\mathsf{Ent}(I)\right)+\Delta_{[2]}^{-2}\ln\ln\Delta_{[2]}^{-1}\right)$.
If the conjecture is true, we would have a complete understanding of the
instance-wise sample complexity of Best-$1$-Arm.
  We make significant progress towards the resolution of the gap-entropy
conjecture. For the upper bound, we provide a highly nontrivial algorithm which
requires \[O\left(H(I)\cdot\left(\ln\delta^{-1}
+\mathsf{Ent}(I)\right)+\Delta_{[2]}^{-2}\ln\ln\Delta_{[2]}^{-1}\mathrm{polylog}(n,\delta^{-1})\right)\]
samples in expectation. For the lower bound, we show that for any Gaussian
Best-$1$-Arm instance with gaps of the form $2^{-k}$, any $\delta$-correct
monotone algorithm requires $\Omega\left(H(I)\cdot\left(\ln\delta^{-1} +
\mathsf{Ent}(I)\right)\right)$ samples in expectation.","['Lijie Chen', 'Jian Li', 'Mingda Qiao']","['cs.LG', 'cs.DS', 'stat.ML']",2016-08-22 02:05:10+00:00

improve the computational efficiency of solving the lasso problem, which is one
of the most commonly used method for learning sparse representations. To
address today's ever increasing large dataset, effective screening relies on a
tight region bound on the solution to the dual lasso. Typical region bounds are
in the form of an intersection of a sphere and multiple half spaces. One way to
tighten the region bound is using more half spaces, which however, adds to the
overhead of solving the high dimensional optimization problem in lasso
screening. This paper reveals the interesting property that the optimization
problem only depends on the projection of features onto the subspace spanned by
the normals of the half spaces. This property converts an optimization problem
in high dimension to much lower dimension, and thus sheds light on reducing the
computation overhead of lasso screening based on tighter region bounds.","['Yun Wang', 'Peter J. Ramadge']","['cs.LG', 'cs.AI', 'cs.CV', 'stat.ML']",2016-08-21 23:48:43+00:00

Prior research has shown that sequential screening methods offer the greatest
promise in this endeavor. Most existing work on sequential screening targets
the context of tuning parameter selection, where one screens and solves a
sequence of $N$ lasso problems with a fixed grid of geometrically spaced
regularization parameters. In contrast, we focus on the scenario where a target
regularization parameter has already been chosen via cross-validated model
selection, and we then need to solve many lasso instances using this fixed
value. In this context, we propose and explore a feedback controlled sequential
screening scheme. Feedback is used at each iteration to select the next problem
to be solved. This allows the sequence of problems to be adapted to the
instance presented and the number of intermediate problems to be automatically
selected. We demonstrate our feedback scheme using several datasets including a

extract a simplified view or coarse-graining of how a complex system's
components interact. This general task is called community detection in
networks and is analogous to searching for clusters in independent vector data.
It is common to evaluate the performance of community detection algorithms by
their ability to find so-called ""ground truth"" communities. This works well in
synthetic networks with planted communities because such networks' links are
formed explicitly based on those known communities. However, there are no
planted communities in real world networks. Instead, it is standard practice to
treat some observed discrete-valued node attributes, or metadata, as ground
truth. Here, we show that metadata are not the same as ground truth, and that
treating them as such induces severe theoretical and practical problems. We
prove that no algorithm can uniquely solve community detection, and we prove a
general No Free Lunch theorem for community detection, which implies that there
can be no algorithm that is optimal for all possible community detection tasks.
However, community detection remains a powerful tool and node metadata still
have value so a careful exploration of their relationship with network
structure can yield insights of genuine worth. We illustrate this point by
introducing two statistical techniques that can quantify the relationship
between metadata and community structure for a broad class of models. We
demonstrate these techniques using both synthetic and real-world networks, and

consensus data objects grouping across multi-views with their graph laplacian
matrices, is a fundamental clustering problem. Among the existing methods,
Low-Rank Representation (LRR) based method is quite superior in terms of its
effectiveness, intuitiveness and robustness to noise corruptions. However, it
aggressively tries to learn a common low-dimensional subspace for multi-view
data, while inattentively ignoring the local manifold structure in each view,
which is critically important to the spectral clustering; worse still, the
low-rank minimization is enforced to achieve the data correlation consensus
among all views, failing to flexibly preserve the local manifold structure for
each view. In this paper, 1) we propose a multi-graph laplacian regularized LRR
with each graph laplacian corresponding to one view to characterize its local
manifold structure. 2) Instead of directly enforcing the low-rank minimization
among all views for correlation consensus, we separately impose low-rank
constraint on each view, coupled with a mutual structural consensus constraint,
where it is able to not only well preserve the local manifold structure but
also serve as a constraint for that from other views, which iteratively makes
the views more agreeable. Extensive experiments on real-world multi-view data

as a low-rank subspace tracking problem for normal flows under incomplete

traffic data is large-scale time-structured data accompanied with noise and
outliers under partial observations, an efficient modeling method is essential.
To this end, this paper proposes an online subspace tracking of a Hankelized

decomposition exploiting the recursive least squares (RLS) algorithm. We
estimate abnormal flows as outlier sparse flows via sparsity maximization in
the underlying under-constrained linear-inverse problem. A major advantage is
that our algorithm estimates normal flows by low-dimensional matrices with
time-directional features as well as the spatial correlation of multiple links
without using the past observed measurements and the past model parameters.
Extensive numerical evaluations show that the proposed algorithm achieves
faster convergence per iteration of model approximation, and better volume

unboundedly by centering a Gaussian on a single datapoint and shrinking the
covariance, we constrain the problem by assuming that the parameters of the
individual models are members of a large discrete set (e.g. estimating a
mixture of two Gaussians where the means and variances of both Gaussians are
members of a set of a million possible means and variances). For this setting
we show that a simple upper bound on the likelihood can be computed using
convex optimization and we analyze conditions under which the bound is
guaranteed to be tight. This bound can then be used to assess the quality of
solutions found by EM (where the final result is projected on the discrete set)

that in the standard $\ell_p/\ell_q$ setting of Lipschitz-bounded functions

  In the literature, it has been shown that for weakly convex problems with

fail to converge and that with fully Jacobian rule can converge sublinearly.
However, empirically the method with Jacobian update is usually slower than
that with Gauss-Seidel rule. To maintain their advantages, we propose a hybrid
Jacobian and Gauss-Seidel BCU method for solving linearly constrained
multi-block structured convex programming, where the objective may have a
nonseparable quadratic term and separable nonsmooth terms. At each primal block
variable update, the method approximates the augmented Lagrangian function at

SSL can: (1) learn a compact structure from a bigger DNN to reduce computation
cost; (2) obtain a hardware-friendly structured sparsity of DNN to efficiently
accelerate the DNNs evaluation. Experimental results show that SSL achieves on
average 5.1x and 3.1x speedups of convolutional layer computation of AlexNet
against CPU and GPU, respectively, with off-the-shelf libraries. These speedups
are about twice speedups of non-structured sparsity; (3) regularize the DNN
structure to improve classification accuracy. The results show that for
CIFAR-10, regularization on layer depth can reduce 20 layers of a Deep Residual
Network (ResNet) to 18 layers while improve the accuracy from 91.25% to 92.60%,
which is still slightly higher than that of original ResNet with 32 layers. For
AlexNet, structure regularization by SSL also reduces the error by around ~1%.

http://arxiv.org/abs/1608.03643v2,Chi-squared Amplification: Identifying Hidden Hubs,"We consider the following general hidden hubs model: an $n \times n$ random
matrix $A$ with a subset $S$ of $k$ special rows (hubs): entries in rows
outside $S$ are generated from the probability distribution $p_0 \sim
N(0,\sigma_0^2)$; for each row in $S$, some $k$ of its entries are generated
from $p_1 \sim N(0,\sigma_1^2)$, $\sigma_1>\sigma_0$, and the rest of the
entries from $p_0$. The problem is to identify the high-degree hubs
efficiently. This model includes and significantly generalizes the planted
Gaussian Submatrix Model, where the special entries are all in a $k \times k$
submatrix. There are two well-known barriers: if $k\geq c\sqrt{n\ln n}$, just
the row sums are sufficient to find $S$ in the general model. For the submatrix
problem, this can be improved by a $\sqrt{\ln n}$ factor to $k \ge c\sqrt{n}$
by spectral methods or combinatorial methods. In the variant with $p_0=\pm 1$
(with probability $1/2$ each) and $p_1\equiv 1$, neither barrier has been
broken.
  We give a polynomial-time algorithm to identify all the hidden hubs with high
probability for $k \ge n^{0.5-\delta}$ for some $\delta >0$, when
$\sigma_1^2>2\sigma_0^2$. The algorithm extends to the setting where planted
entries might have different variances each at least as large as $\sigma_1^2$.
We also show a nearly matching lower bound: for $\sigma_1^2 \le 2\sigma_0^2$,
there is no polynomial-time Statistical Query algorithm for distinguishing
between a matrix whose entries are all from $N(0,\sigma_0^2)$ and a matrix with
$k=n^{0.5-\delta}$ hidden hubs for any $\delta >0$. The lower bound as well as
the algorithm are related to whether the chi-squared distance of the two
distributions diverges. At the critical value $\sigma_1^2=2\sigma_0^2$, we show
that the general hidden hubs problem can be solved for $k\geq c\sqrt n(\ln
n)^{1/4}$, improving on the naive row sum-based method.","['Ravi Kannan', 'Santosh Vempala']","['cs.LG', 'cs.DS', 'stat.ML']",2016-08-12 00:36:42+00:00

challenging problems for which both projection into the constrained domain and
a linear optimization under the inequality constraint are time-consuming, which
render both projected gradient methods and conditional gradient methods (a.k.a.
the Frank-Wolfe algorithm) expensive. In this paper, we develop projection
reduced optimization algorithms for both smooth and non-smooth optimization
with improved convergence rates under a certain regularity condition of the
constraint function. We first present a general theory of optimization with
only one projection. Its application to smooth optimization with only one
projection yields $O(1/\epsilon)$ iteration complexity, which improves over the
$O(1/\epsilon^2)$ iteration complexity established before for non-smooth
optimization and can be further reduced under strong convexity. Then we
introduce a local error bound condition and develop faster algorithms for
non-strongly convex optimization at the price of a logarithmic number of
projections. In particular, we achieve an iteration complexity of $\widetilde
O(1/\epsilon^{2(1-\theta)})$ for non-smooth optimization and $\widetilde
O(1/\epsilon^{1-\theta})$ for smooth optimization, where $\theta\in(0,1]$
appearing the local error bound condition characterizes the functional local

through December 31, 2011 for each of the 24 hours in a day. The resulting
dynamic components are examined by hour across days for the 3 year period.
Diurnal and seasonal patterns are revealed underlining times when DPCA performs
best and two principal components (PCs) explain most variability in the
multivariate series. DPCA is shown to be superior to static principal component
analysis (PCA) in discovery of linear relations among transformed pollutant
measurements. DPCA captures the time-dependent correlation structure of the
underlying pollutants recorded at up to 34 monitoring sites in the region. In
winter mornings the first principal component (PC1) (mainly CO and NO2)
explains up to 70% of variability. Augmenting with the second principal
component (PC2) (mainly driven by SO2) the explained variability rises to 90%.
In the afternoon, O3 gains prominence in the second principal component. The
seasonal profile of PCs' contribution to variance loses its distinction in the
afternoon, yet cumulatively PC1 and PC2 still explain up to 65% of variability

employs a novel computationally efficient procedure that speeds up the search
by anticipating future selections via choosing $L$ columns in each step, where
$L$ is an adjustable hyper-parameter. We analyze the performance of AOLS and
