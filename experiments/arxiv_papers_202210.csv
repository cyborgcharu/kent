inference with observational data via Bayesian nonparametric regression
adjustment, with a focus on high-dimensional settings featuring multiple
actions and multiple correlated outcomes. We present a general class of
counterfactual multi-task deep kernels models that estimate causal effects and
learn policies proficiently thanks to their sample efficiency gains, while
scaling well with high dimensions. In the first part of the work, we rely on
Structural Causal Models (SCM) to formally introduce the setup and the problem
of identifying counterfactual quantities under observed confounding. We then
discuss the benefits of tackling the task of causal effects estimation via
stacked coregionalized Gaussian Processes and Deep Kernels. Finally, we
demonstrate the use of the proposed methods on simulated experiments that span
individual causal effects estimation, off-policy evaluation and optimization.","['Alberto Caron', 'Gianluca Baio', 'Ioanna Manolopoulou']","['cs.LG', 'stat.ML']",2022-11-20 23:28:41+00:00

dynamical system is an important challenge in utilizing such models. Motivated
by the computational cost of sampling-based approaches, we consider
approximations of the model's output and trajectory distribution. We show that
previous work on uncertainty propagation, focussed on discrete state-space
models, incorrectly included an independence assumption between subsequent
states of the predicted trajectories. Expanding these ideas to continuous
ordinary differential equation models, we illustrate the implications of this

networks is still an open problem in the deep learning literature. Although
their remarkable performance has been mostly attributed to the self-attention
mechanism, the literature still lacks a solid analysis of these networks and
interpretation of the functions learned by them. To this end, we study the
training problem of attention/transformer networks and introduce a novel convex
analytic approach to improve the understanding and optimization of these
networks. Particularly, we first introduce a convex alternative to the
self-attention mechanism and reformulate the regularized training problem of
transformer networks with our alternative convex attention. Then, we cast the
reformulation as a convex optimization problem that is interpretable and easier
to optimize. Moreover, as a byproduct of our convex analysis, we reveal an
implicit regularization mechanism, which promotes sparsity across tokens.
Therefore, we not only improve the optimization of attention/transformer
networks but also provide a solid theoretical understanding of the functions
learned by them. We also demonstrate the effectiveness of our theory through
several numerical experiments.","['Tolga Ergen', 'Behnam Neyshabur', 'Harsh Mehta']","['cs.LG', 'cs.AI', 'cs.CL', 'stat.ML']",2022-11-20 18:17:47+00:00

business intelligence for a wide range of decisions, such as demand forecasting
and pricing. However, human analysts may have their own insights and
experiences about the decision-making that is at odds with the algorithmic
recommendation. In view of such a conflict, we provide a general analytical
framework to study the augmentation of algorithmic decisions with human
knowledge: the analyst uses the knowledge to set a guardrail by which the
algorithmic decision is clipped if the algorithmic output is out of bound, and
seems unreasonable. We study the conditions under which the augmentation is
beneficial relative to the raw algorithmic decision. We show that when the
algorithmic decision is asymptotically optimal with large data, the
non-data-driven human guardrail usually provides no benefit. However, we point
out three common pitfalls of the algorithmic decision: (1) lack of domain
knowledge, such as the market competition, (2) model misspecification, and (3)
data contamination. In these cases, even with sufficient data, the augmentation
from human knowledge can still improve the performance of the algorithmic

to the problem. Benchmarking experiments demonstrate that the proposed approach
obtains competitive to better performance, at a small fraction of the model
complexity of the best alternative approach based on Gradient Boosting.

models, there has been a surge of interests in solving noisy linear inverse
problems, e.g., super-resolution, deblurring, denoising, colorization, etc,
with generative models. However, while remarkable reconstruction performances
have been achieved, their inference time is typically too slow since most of
them rely on the seminal diffusion posterior sampling (DPS) framework and thus
to approximate the intractable likelihood score, time-consuming gradient
calculation through back-propagation is needed. To address this issue, this
paper provides a fast and effective solution by proposing a simple closed-form
approximation to the likelihood score. For both diffusion and flow-based
models, extensive experiments are conducted on various noisy linear inverse
problems such as noisy super-resolution, denoising, deblurring, and

Important applications include causal heterogenous treatment effects and
dynamic policy decisions, as well as conditional quantile regression and design
of experiments, where tree estimation and inference is conducted at specific
values of the covariates. In this paper, we call into question the use of
decision trees (trained by adaptive recursive partitioning) for such purposes
by demonstrating that they can fail to achieve polynomial rates of convergence
in uniform norm with non-vanishing probability, even with pruning. Instead, the
convergence may be arbitrarily slow or, in some important special cases, such
as honest regression trees, fail completely. We show that random forests can
remedy the situation, turning poor performing trees into nearly optimal
procedures, at the cost of losing interpretability and introducing two
additional tuning parameters. The two hallmarks of random forests, subsampling

condition of censored time-to-event data called BENK (the Beran Estimator with
Neural Kernels) is proposed. The main idea behind the method is to apply the
Beran estimator for estimating the survival functions of controls and
treatments. Instead of typical kernel functions in the Beran estimator, it is
proposed to implement kernels in the form of neural networks of a specific form
called the neural kernels. The conditional average treatment effect is
estimated by using the survival functions as outcomes of the control and
treatment neural networks which consists of a set of neural kernels with shared
parameters. The neural kernels are more flexible and can accurately model a
complex location structure of feature vectors. Various numerical simulation
experiments illustrate BENK and compare it with the well-known T-learner,
S-learner and X-learner for several types of the control and treatment outcome

wish to do so without assuming access to such an oracle during training or
validation, with makes evaluation non-straightforward. While an approximation
to the ground oracle can be trained and used in place of it during model
validation to measure the mean reward over generated candidates, the evaluation
is approximate and vulnerable to adversarial examples. Measuring the mean
reward of generated candidates over this approximation is one such `validation
metric', whereas we are interested in a more fundamental question which is
finding which validation metrics correlate the most with the ground truth. This
involves proposing validation metrics and quantifying them over many datasets
for which the ground truth is known, for instance simulated environments. This
is encapsulated under our proposed evaluation framework which is also designed
to measure extrapolation, which is the ultimate goal behind leveraging
generative models for MBO. While our evaluation framework is model agnostic we

enables the joint discovery of governing equations and coordinate systems with
a theoretically guaranteed uncertainty estimate. To resolve the challenging
computational tractability of the Bayesian hierarchical setting, we adapt an

users to understand what an ML model has learned, ML explainability has become
a field of active research. In Part I of this two-part study, we described
several explainability methods and demonstrated that feature rankings from
different methods can substantially disagree with each other. It is unclear,
though, whether the disagreement is overinflated due to some methods being less
faithful in assigning importance. Herein, ""faithfulness"" or ""fidelity"" refer to
the correspondence between the assigned feature importance and the contribution
of the feature to model performance. In the present study, we evaluate the
faithfulness of feature ranking methods using multiple methods. Given the
sensitivity of explanation methods to feature correlations, we also quantify
how much explainability faithfulness improves after correlated features are
limited. Before dimensionality reduction, the feature relevance methods [e.g.,
SHAP, LIME, ALE variance, and logistic regression (LR) coefficients] were
generally more faithful than the permutation importance methods due to the
negative impact of correlated features. Once correlated features were reduced,
traditional permutation importance became the most faithful method. In
addition, the ranking uncertainty (i.e., the spread in rank assigned to a
feature by the different ranking methods) was reduced by a factor of 2-10, and
excluding less faithful feature ranking methods reduces it further. This study
is one of the first to quantify the improvement in explainability from limiting
correlated features and knowing the relative fidelity of different

underlying hierarchical structure to be embedded in hyperbolic spaces.
Consequently, many tools of machine learning were extended to such spaces, but
only few discrepancies to compare probability distributions defined over those

well defined on such Riemannian manifolds and enjoy strong theoretical
properties, but suffer from high computational cost. On Euclidean spaces,
sliced-Wasserstein distances, which leverage a closed-form of the Wasserstein
distance in one dimension, are more computationally efficient, but are not
readily available on hyperbolic spaces. In this work, we propose to derive
novel hyperbolic sliced-Wasserstein discrepancies. These constructions use
projections on the underlying geodesics either along horospheres or geodesics.

interventions made to promote path independence result in improved
generalization on harder problem instances, while those that penalize it
degrade this ability. Path independence analyses are also useful on a

in healthcare is complicated by the issue of confounding medical interventions
(CMI): when an algorithm predicts a patient to be at high risk for an adverse
event, clinicians are more likely to administer prophylactic treatment and
alter the very target that the algorithm aims to predict. A simple approach is
to ignore CMI and monitor only the untreated patients, whose outcomes remain
unaltered. In general, ignoring CMI may inflate Type I error because (i)
untreated patients disproportionally represent those with low predicted risk
and (ii) evolution in both the model and clinician trust in the model can
induce complex dependencies that violate standard assumptions. Nevertheless, we
show that valid inference is still possible if one monitors conditional

comparably to an offline optimal strategy. In online nonstochastic control,
both the cost functions as well as the perturbations from the assumed dynamical
model are chosen by an adversary. Thus the optimal policy is not defined a

hindsight from a benchmark class of policies.
  This objective suggests the use of the decision making framework of online

parameters as weights, and outputs equilibrium voltages. Optimal rule
parameters can be found by training the DNN so its output approaches unity for
various scenarios. The DNN is only used to optimize rules and is never employed

Additionally, most of these methods, being data-intensive, cannot be supported

laser operates as the agent across the $P-v$ space such that it maximizes
rewards for a melt pool depth closer to the optimum. The culmination of the
training process yields a Q-table where the state ($P,v$) with the highest

preprocessing such as missing value imputation to work on incomplete data sets.
However, imputation alone does not encode useful information about the missing
values themselves. For data sets with informative missing patterns, the Missing
Indicator Method (MIM), which adds indicator variables to indicate the missing
pattern, can be used in conjunction with imputation to improve model
performance. While commonly used in data science, MIM is surprisingly
understudied from an empirical and especially theoretical perspective. In this

informative missing values, and we prove that MIM does not hurt linear models
asymptotically for uninformative missing values. Additionally, we find that for
high-dimensional data sets with many uninformative indicators, MIM can induce
model overfitting and thus test performance. To address this issue, we

indicators only for features that have informative missing patterns. We show

seriously limited the application of overlapping group lasso regularization in
many modern problems, such as gene pathway selection and graphical model

of the overlapping group lasso penalty. Thanks to the separability, the
computation of regularization based on our penalty is substantially faster than
that of the overlapping group lasso, especially for large-scale and
high-dimensional problems. We show that the penalty is the tightest separable
relaxation of the overlapping group lasso norm within the family of

hyperspherical context. Specifically, we characterise the native spaces
(reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces) and the Sobolev spaces associated with
kernels defined over hyperspheres. Our results have direct consequences for
kernel cubature, determining the rate of convergence of the worst case error,
and expanding the applicability of cubature algorithms based on Stein's method.
We first introduce a suitable characterisation on Sobolev spaces on the
$d$-dimensional hypersphere embedded in $(d+1)$-dimensional Euclidean spaces.
Our characterisation is based on the Fourier--Schoenberg sequences associated
with a given kernel. Such sequences are hard (if not impossible) to compute
analytically on $d$-dimensional spheres, but often feasible over Hilbert
spheres. We circumvent this problem by finding a projection operator that
allows to Fourier mapping from Hilbert into finite dimensional hyperspheres. We
illustrate our findings through some parametric families of kernels.","['Simon Hubbert', 'Emilio Porcu', 'Chris. J. Oates', 'Mark Girolami']","['stat.ML', 'cs.LG']",2022-11-16 20:31:38+00:00

http://arxiv.org/abs/2211.09101v1,Comparative Learning: A Sample Complexity Theory for Two Hypothesis Classes,"In many learning theory problems, a central role is played by a hypothesis
class: we might assume that the data is labeled according to a hypothesis in
the class (usually referred to as the realizable setting), or we might evaluate
the learned model by comparing it with the best hypothesis in the class (the
agnostic setting).
  Taking a step beyond these classic setups that involve only a single
hypothesis class, we introduce comparative learning as a combination of the
realizable and agnostic settings in PAC learning: given two binary hypothesis
classes $S$ and $B$, we assume that the data is labeled according to a
hypothesis in the source class $S$ and require the learned model to achieve an
accuracy comparable to the best hypothesis in the benchmark class $B$. Even
when both $S$ and $B$ have infinite VC dimensions, comparative learning can
still have a small sample complexity. We show that the sample complexity of
comparative learning is characterized by the mutual VC dimension
$\mathsf{VC}(S,B)$ which we define to be the maximum size of a subset shattered
by both $S$ and $B$. We also show a similar result in the online setting, where
we give a regret characterization in terms of the mutual Littlestone dimension
$\mathsf{Ldim}(S,B)$. These results also hold for partial hypotheses.
  We additionally show that the insights necessary to characterize the sample
complexity of comparative learning can be applied to characterize the sample
complexity of realizable multiaccuracy and multicalibration using the mutual
fat-shattering dimension, an analogue of the mutual VC dimension for
real-valued hypotheses. This not only solves an open problem proposed by Hu,
Peale, Reingold (2022), but also leads to independently interesting results
extending classic ones about regression, boosting, and covering number to our
two-hypothesis-class setting.","['Lunjia Hu', 'Charlotte Peale']","['cs.LG', 'cs.CC', 'cs.DS', 'stat.ML']",2022-11-16 18:38:24+00:00

different explanation methods, how to interpret them, and provide a complete
Python package (scikit-explain) to allow future researchers to explore these

methods for feature rankings and feature effects and provide practical advice
for dealing with these disagreements. We used ML models developed for severe
weather prediction and sub-freezing road surface temperature prediction to
generalize the behavior of the different explanation methods. For feature
rankings, there is substantially more agreement on the set of top features

parameter sharing to further improve the extended PINN (XPINN) as well as the
vanilla PINN methods. In particular, a trainable gate network is employed to
mimic the hard decomposition of XPINN, which can be flexibly fine-tuned for
discovering a potentially better partition. It weight-averages several sub-nets
as the output of APINN. APINN does not require complex interface conditions,
and its sub-nets can take advantage of all training samples rather than just
part of the training data in their subdomains. Lastly, each sub-net shares part
of the common parameters to capture the similar components in each decomposed
function. Furthermore, following the PINN generalization theory in Hu et al.
[2021], we show that APINN can improve generalization by proper gate network
initialization and general domain & function decomposition. Extensive
experiments on different types of PDEs demonstrate how APINN improves the PINN
and XPINN methods. Specifically, we present examples where XPINN performs
similarly to or worse than PINN, so that APINN can significantly improve both.
We also show cases where XPINN is already better than PINN, so APINN can still
slightly improve XPINN. Furthermore, we visualize the optimized gating networks
and their optimization trajectories, and connect them with their performance,
which helps discover the possibly optimal decomposition. Interestingly, if
initialized by different decomposition, the performances of corresponding
APINNs can differ drastically. This, in turn, shows the potential to design an
optimal domain decomposition for the differential equation problem under
consideration.","['Zheyuan Hu', 'Ameya D. Jagtap', 'George Em Karniadakis', 'Kenji Kawaguchi']","['cs.LG', 'cs.NA', 'math.DS', 'math.NA', 'stat.ML']",2022-11-16 14:35:10+00:00

and industry. Due to the lack of anomalous data in many practical cases, AD is
usually solved by first modeling the normal data pattern and then determining
if data fit this model. Generative models (GMs) seem a natural tool to achieve
this purpose, which learn the normal data distribution and estimate it using a
probability density function (PDF). However, some works have observed the ideal
performance of such GM-based AD methods. In this paper, we propose a new
perspective on the ideal performance of GM-based AD methods. We state that in
these methods, the implicit assumption that connects GMs'results to AD's goal
is usually implausible due to normal data's multi-peaked distribution
characteristic, which is quite common in practical cases. We first
qualitatively formulate this perspective, and then focus on the Gaussian
mixture model (GMM) to intuitively illustrate the perspective, which is a
typical GM and has the natural property to approximate multi-peaked
distributions. Based on the proposed perspective, in order to bypass the
implicit assumption in the GMM-based AD method, we suggest integrating the
Discriminative idea to orient GMM to AD tasks (DiGMM). With DiGMM, we establish
a connection of generative and discriminative models, which are two key
paradigms for AD and are usually treated separately before. This connection
provides a possible direction for future works to jointly consider the two
paradigms and incorporate their complementary characteristics for AD.","['Jingxuan Pang', 'Chunguang Li']","['cs.LG', 'cs.AI', 'stat.ML']",2022-11-16 13:42:01+00:00

engaging way to learn computer science. However, teaching and giving feedback

to manually grade student-implemented interactive programs. As a result, online
platforms that serve millions, like Code.org, are unable to provide any

generalization of OT makes it robust to outliers and missing data. The second
workhorse of modern computational OT is entropic regularization, which leads to
scalable algorithms while lowering the sample complexity in high dimension. The
last point presented in this review is the Gromov-Wasserstein (GW) distance,
which extends OT to cope with distributions belonging to different metric

use and accuracy. In this paper, we explore the close connections between TAR
models and regression trees. These enable us to use the rich methodology from
the literature on TAR models to define a hierarchical TAR model as a regression
tree that trains globally across series, which we call SETAR-Tree. In contrast
to the general-purpose tree-based models that do not primarily focus on
forecasting, and calculate averages at the leaf nodes, we introduce a new
forecasting-specific tree algorithm that trains global Pooled Regression (PR)
models in the leaves allowing the models to learn cross-series information and
also uses some time-series-specific splitting and stopping procedures. The
depth of the tree is controlled by conducting a statistical linearity test
commonly employed in TAR models, as well as measuring the error reduction
percentage at each node split. Thus, the proposed tree model requires minimal
external hyperparameter tuning and provides competitive results under its
default configuration. We also use this tree algorithm to develop a forest

time stamps and associated event types (""marks""), are an important type of
sequential data with many applications, e.g., in clinical medicine or user

(e.g., using neural Hawkes processes or their classical counterparts), it is
natural to ask questions about future scenarios such as ""what kind of event
will occur next"" or ""will an event of type $A$ occur before one of type $B$"".
Unfortunately, some of these queries are notoriously hard to address since
current methods are limited to naive simulation, which can be highly
inefficient. This paper introduces a new typology of query types and a
framework for addressing them using importance sampling. Example queries
include predicting the $n^\text{th}$ event type in a sequence and the hitting
time distribution of one or more event types. We also leverage these findings
further to be applicable for estimating general ""$A$ before $B$"" type of

model-free but has exponential cost in the dimension of the input space. A
supervised on-manifold Shapley method from Frye et al. (2020) is also model

cohort Shapley, called IGCS, with cost $\mathcal{O}(nd)$. We show that over the
vast majority of the relevant unit cube that the IGCS value function is close
to a multilinear function for which IGCS matches CS. Another benefit of IGCS is
that is allows IG methods to be used with binary predictors. We use some area
between curves (ABC) measures to quantify the performance of IGCS. On a problem

famous alternate optimization algorithm weighted minimum mean square error

Specifically, with the possibility of power policy shifting in the hidden

making. A method called synthetic control (SC) is used to estimate the
counterfactual. For any link in the known network, SC constructs a convex
combination of the interference on other links and uses it as an estimate for
the counterfactual. Power iteration in the proposed SC-WMMSE is performed
taking into account both the observed interference and its counterfactual.
SC-WMMSE requires no more information than the original WMMSE in the
optimization stage. To our best knowledge, this is the first paper explores the

loss function for single-channel reverberant speech separation. Prior methods
for unsupervised separation required the synthesis of mixtures of mixtures or
assumed the existence of a teacher model, making them difficult to consider as
potential methods explaining the emergence of separation abilities in an
animal's auditory system. We assume the availability of two-channel mixtures at
training time, and train a neural network to separate the sources given one of
the channels as input such that the other channel may be predicted from the
separated sources. As the relationship between the room impulse responses
(RIRs) of each channel depends on the locations of the sources, which are
unknown to the network, the network cannot rely on learning that relationship.
Instead, our proposed loss function fits each of the separated sources to the
mixture in the target channel via Wiener filtering, and compares the resulting
mixture to the ground-truth one. We show that minimizing the scale-invariant
signal-to-distortion ratio (SI-SDR) of the predicted right-channel mixture with
respect to the ground truth implicitly guides the network towards separating
the left-channel sources. On a semi-supervised reverberant speech separation

  To avoid this known circularity, we instead suggest a notion of
'phenomenological causality' whose basic concept is a set of elementary
actions. Then the causal structure is defined such that elementary actions
change only the causal mechanism at one node (e.g. one of the causal
conditionals in the Markov factorization). This way, the Principle of
Independent Mechanisms becomes the defining property of causal structure in
domains where causality is a more abstract phenomenon rather than being an
objective fact relying on hard-wired causal links between tangible objects. We

http://arxiv.org/abs/2211.07482v3,Unifying O(3) Equivariant Neural Networks Design with Tensor-Network Formalism,"Many learning tasks, including learning potential energy surfaces from ab
initio calculations, involve global spatial symmetries and permutational
symmetry between atoms or general particles. Equivariant graph neural networks
are a standard approach to such problems, with one of the most successful
methods employing tensor products between various tensors that transform under
the spatial group. However, as the number of different tensors and the
complexity of relationships between them increase, maintaining parsimony and
equivariance becomes increasingly challenging. In this paper, we propose using
fusion diagrams, a technique widely employed in simulating SU($2$)-symmetric
quantum many-body problems, to design new equivariant components for
equivariant neural networks. This results in a diagrammatic approach to
constructing novel neural network architectures. When applied to particles
within a given local neighborhood, the resulting components, which we term
""fusion blocks,"" serve as universal approximators of any continuous equivariant
function defined in the neighborhood. We incorporate a fusion block into
pre-existing equivariant architectures (Cormorant and MACE), leading to
improved performance with fewer parameters on a range of challenging chemical
problems. Furthermore, we apply group-equivariant neural networks to study
non-adiabatic molecular dynamics of stilbene cis-trans isomerization. Our
approach, which combines tensor networks with equivariant neural networks,
suggests a potentially fruitful direction for designing more expressive
equivariant neural networks.","['Zimu Li', 'Zihan Pengmei', 'Han Zheng', 'Erik Thiede', 'Junyu Liu', 'Risi Kondor']","['cs.LG', 'cs.AI', 'quant-ph', 'stat.ML']",2022-11-14 16:06:59+00:00
http://arxiv.org/abs/2211.07451v3,Additive Covariance Matrix Models: Modelling Regional Electricity Net-Demand in Great Britain,"Forecasts of regional electricity net-demand, consumption minus embedded
generation, are an essential input for reliable and economic power system
operation, and energy trading. While such forecasts are typically performed
region by region, operations such as managing power flows require spatially
coherent joint forecasts, which account for cross-regional dependencies. Here,
we forecast the joint distribution of net-demand across the 14 regions
constituting Great Britain's electricity network. Joint modelling is
complicated by the fact that the net-demand variability within each region, and
the dependencies between regions, vary with temporal, socio-economical and
weather-related factors. We accommodate for these characteristics by proposing
a multivariate Gaussian model based on a modified Cholesky parametrisation,
which allows us to model each unconstrained parameter via an additive model.
Given that the number of model parameters and covariates is large, we adopt a
semi-automated approach to model selection, based on gradient boosting. In
addition to comparing the forecasting performance of several versions of the
proposed model with that of two non-Gaussian copula-based models, we visually
explore the model output to interpret how the covariates affect net-demand
variability and dependencies.
