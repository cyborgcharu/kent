algorithm for inference of latent variable problems. A theoretical
understanding of its performance, however, largely remains lacking. Recent
results established that EM enjoys global convergence for Gaussian Mixture
Models. For Mixed Linear Regression, however, only local convergence results
have been established, and those only for the high SNR regime. We show here
that EM converges for mixed linear regression with two components (it is known
that it may fail to converge for three or more), and moreover that this
convergence holds for random initialization. Our analysis reveals that EM
exhibits very different behavior in Mixed Linear Regression from its behavior
in Gaussian Mixture Models, and hence our proofs require the development of
several new ideas.","['Jeongyeol Kwon', 'Wei Qian', 'Constantine Caramanis', 'Yudong Chen', 'Damek Davis']","['stat.ML', 'cs.LG', 'math.ST', 'stat.TH']",2018-10-12 22:59:30+00:00
http://arxiv.org/abs/1810.05751v2,Policy Transfer with Strategy Optimization,"Computer simulation provides an automatic and safe way for training robotic
control policies to achieve complex tasks such as locomotion. However, a policy
trained in simulation usually does not transfer directly to the real hardware
due to the differences between the two environments. Transfer learning using
domain randomization is a promising approach, but it usually assumes that the
target environment is close to the distribution of the training environments,
thus relying heavily on accurate system identification. In this paper, we
present a different approach that leverages domain randomization for
transferring control policies to unknown environments. The key idea that,
instead of learning a single policy in the simulation, we simultaneously learn
a family of policies that exhibit different behaviors. When tested in the
target environment, we directly search for the best policy in the family based
on the task performance, without the need to identify the dynamic parameters.
We evaluate our method on five simulated robotic control problems with
different discrepancies in the training and testing environment and demonstrate
that our method can overcome larger modeling errors compared to training a
robust policy or an adaptive policy.","['Wenhao Yu', 'C. Karen Liu', 'Greg Turk']","['cs.LG', 'cs.RO', 'stat.ML']",2018-10-12 22:53:30+00:00

neural network topology, outperforming many manual architecture designs.
However, it can be prohibitively expensive as the search requires training
thousands of different networks, while each can last for hours. In this work,
we propose the Graph HyperNetwork (GHN) to amortize the search cost: given an
architecture, it directly generates the weights by running inference on a graph
neural network. GHNs model the topology of an architecture and therefore can
predict network performance more accurately than regular hypernetworks and
premature early stopping. To perform NAS, we randomly sample architectures and
use the validation accuracy of networks with GHN generated weights as the
surrogate search signal. GHNs are fast -- they can search nearly 10 times
faster than other random search methods on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet. GHNs can be
further extended to the anytime prediction setting, where they have found
networks with better speed-accuracy tradeoff than the state-of-the-art manual
designs.","['Chris Zhang', 'Mengye Ren', 'Raquel Urtasun']","['cs.LG', 'cs.CV', 'stat.ML']",2018-10-12 22:21:05+00:00

future of Machine Learning. In this paper, we pioneer the question of the
global interpretability of learned black box models that assign numerical
values to symbolic sequential data. To tackle that task, we propose a spectral
algorithm for the extraction of weighted automata (WA) from such black boxes.
This algorithm does not require the access to a dataset or to the inner
representation of the black box: the inferred model can be obtained solely by
querying the black box, feeding it with inputs and analyzing its outputs.

http://arxiv.org/abs/1810.05728v4,Estimating Information Flow in Deep Neural Networks,"We study the flow of information and the evolution of internal
representations during deep neural network (DNN) training, aiming to demystify
the compression aspect of the information bottleneck theory. The theory
suggests that DNN training comprises a rapid fitting phase followed by a slower
compression phase, in which the mutual information $I(X;T)$ between the input
$X$ and internal representations $T$ decreases. Several papers observe
compression of estimated mutual information on different DNN models, but the
true $I(X;T)$ over these networks is provably either constant (discrete $X$) or
infinite (continuous $X$). This work explains the discrepancy between theory
and experiments, and clarifies what was actually measured by these past works.
To this end, we introduce an auxiliary (noisy) DNN framework for which $I(X;T)$
is a meaningful quantity that depends on the network's parameters. This noisy
framework is shown to be a good proxy for the original (deterministic) DNN both
in terms of performance and the learned representations. We then develop a
rigorous estimator for $I(X;T)$ in noisy DNNs and observe compression in
various models. By relating $I(X;T)$ in the noisy DNN to an
information-theoretic communication problem, we show that compression is driven
by the progressive clustering of hidden representations of inputs from the same
class. Several methods to directly monitor clustering of hidden
representations, both in noisy and deterministic DNNs, are used to show that
meaningful clusters form in the $T$ space. Finally, we return to the estimator
of $I(X;T)$ employed in past works, and demonstrate that while it fails to
capture the true (vacuous) mutual information, it does serve as a measure for
clustering. This clarifies the past observations of compression and isolates
the geometric clustering of hidden representations as the true phenomenon of
interest.","['Ziv Goldfeld', 'Ewout van den Berg', 'Kristjan Greenewald', 'Igor Melnyk', 'Nam Nguyen', 'Brian Kingsbury', 'Yury Polyanskiy']","['cs.LG', 'stat.ML']",2018-10-12 21:11:30+00:00

reconstruction problems. However, it is not well understood what properties of
the latent representation may improve the generalization ability of the
network. Furthermore, limited models have been presented for inverse
reconstructions over time sequences. In this paper, we study the generalization
ability of a sequence encoder decoder model for solving inverse reconstructions
on time sequences. Our central hypothesis is that the generalization ability of
the network can be improved by 1) constrained stochasticity and 2) global
aggregation of temporal information in the latent space. First, drawing from
analytical learning theory, we theoretically show that a stochastic latent
space will lead to an improved generalization ability. Second, we consider an
LSTM encoder-decoder architecture that compresses a global latent vector from
all last-layer units in the LSTM encoder. This model is compared with
alternative LSTM encoder-decoder architectures, each in deterministic and
stochastic versions. The results demonstrate that the generalization ability of
an inverse reconstruction network can be improved by constrained stochasticity
combined with global aggregation of temporal information in the latent space.","['Sandesh Ghimire', 'Prashnna Kumar Gyawali', 'John L Sapp', 'Milan Horacek', 'Linwei Wang']","['cs.LG', 'stat.ML']",2018-10-12 20:42:23+00:00

outstanding performance, but at the cost of intensive computation. As
significant redundancies inevitably present in such a structure, many works
have been proposed to prune the convolutional filters for computation cost
reduction. Although extremely effective, most works are based only on
quantitative characteristics of the convolutional filters, and highly overlook
the qualitative interpretation of individual filter's specific functionality.
In this work, we interpreted the functionality and redundancy of the
convolutional filters from different perspectives, and proposed a
functionality-oriented filter pruning method. With extensive experiment
results, we proved the convolutional filters' qualitative significance
regardless of magnitude, demonstrated significant neural network redundancy due
to repetitive filter functions, and analyzed the filter functionality defection
under inappropriate retraining process. Such an interpretable pruning approach
not only offers outstanding computation cost optimization over previous filter

http://arxiv.org/abs/1810.05691v4,"Faster k-Medoids Clustering: Improving the PAM, CLARA, and CLARANS Algorithms","Clustering non-Euclidean data is difficult, and one of the most used
algorithms besides hierarchical clustering is the popular algorithm
Partitioning Around Medoids (PAM), also simply referred to as k-medoids. In
Euclidean geometry the mean-as used in k-means-is a good estimator for the
cluster center, but this does not hold for arbitrary dissimilarities. PAM uses
the medoid instead, the object with the smallest dissimilarity to all others in
the cluster. This notion of centrality can be used with any (dis-)similarity,
and thus is of high relevance to many domains such as biology that require the
use of Jaccard, Gower, or more complex distances.
  A key issue with PAM is its high run time cost. We propose modifications to
the PAM algorithm to achieve an O(k)-fold speedup in the second SWAP phase of
the algorithm, but will still find the same results as the original PAM
algorithm. If we slightly relax the choice of swaps performed (at comparable
quality), we can further accelerate the algorithm by performing up to k swaps
in each iteration. With the substantially faster SWAP, we can now also explore
alternative strategies for choosing the initial medoids. We also show how the
CLARA and CLARANS algorithms benefit from these modifications. It can easily be
combined with earlier approaches to use PAM and CLARA on big data (some of
which use PAM as a subroutine, hence can immediately benefit from these
improvements), where the performance with high k becomes increasingly
important.
  In experiments on real data with k=100, we observed a 200-fold speedup
compared to the original PAM SWAP algorithm, making PAM applicable to larger
data sets as long as we can afford to compute a distance matrix, and in
particular to higher k (at k=2, the new SWAP was only 1.5 times faster, as the
speedup is expected to increase with k).","['Erich Schubert', 'Peter J. Rousseeuw']","['cs.LG', 'stat.ML']",2018-10-12 19:26:28+00:00

of attention as ensuring it will ensure continued confidence of the general
public in the deployment of machine learning systems. We focus on mitigating
the harm incurred by a biased machine learning system that offers better
outputs (e.g. loans, job interviews) for certain groups than for others. We
show that bias in the output can naturally be controlled in probabilistic
models by introducing a latent target output. This formulation has several
advantages: first, it is a unified framework for several notions of group
fairness such as Demographic Parity and Equality of Opportunity; second, it is
expressed as a marginalisation instead of a constrained problem; and third, it
allows the encoding of our knowledge of what unbiased outputs should be.
Practically, the second allows us to avoid unstable constrained optimisation
procedures and to reuse off-the-shelf toolboxes. The latter translates to the
ability to control the level of fairness by directly varying fairness target
rates. In contrast, existing approaches rely on intermediate, arguably
unintuitive, control parameters such as covariance thresholds.","['Thomas Kehrenberg', 'Zexun Chen', 'Novi Quadrianto']","['stat.ML', 'cs.LG']",2018-10-12 16:36:23+00:00

the 2D self-position of the agent is represented by a high-dimensional vector,
and the 2D self-motion or displacement of the agent is represented by a matrix
that transforms the vector. Each component of the vector is a unit or a cell.
The model consists of the following three sub-models. (1) Vector-matrix
multiplication. The movement from the current position to the next position is
modeled by matrix-vector multiplication, i.e., the vector of the next position
is obtained by multiplying the matrix of the motion to the vector of the
current position. (2) Magnified local isometry. The angle between two nearby
vectors equals the Euclidean distance between the two corresponding positions
multiplied by a magnifying factor. (3) Global adjacency kernel. The inner
product between two vectors measures the adjacency between the two
corresponding positions, which is defined by a kernel function of the Euclidean
distance between the two positions. Our representational model has explicit
algebra and geometry. It can learn hexagon patterns of grid cells, and it is
capable of error correction, path integral and path planning.","['Ruiqi Gao', 'Jianwen Xie', 'Song-Chun Zhu', 'Ying Nian Wu']","['stat.ML', 'cs.LG', 'cs.NE']",2018-10-12 16:34:07+00:00

create query algorithms to guide the search for points that provide the most

have focused on developing utility models and query algorithms for discovering
unknown unknowns --- misclassifications with a predictive confidence above some
arbitrary threshold. However, if misclassifications occur at the rate reflected
by the confidence values, then these search methods reveal nothing more than a
proper assessment of predictive certainty. We are unable to properly mitigate
the risks associated with model deficiency when the model's confidence in
prediction exceeds the actual model accuracy. We propose a facility locations
utility model and corresponding greedy query algorithm that instead searches
for overconfident unknown unknowns. Through robust empirical experiments we

well in reconstructing the posterior and the model evidence with a limited

regularising parameters about values drawn from a distribution which can be set
equal to the prior. A theoretical analysis of the procedure in a simplified
setting suggests the recovered posterior is centred correctly but tends to have
an underestimated marginal variance, and overestimated correlation. However,
two conditions can lead to exact recovery. We argue that these conditions are

linear regression fit to a dataset for which the correspondences between the
independent samples and the observations are unknown. Such a problem naturally
arises in diverse domains such as computer vision, data mining, communications
and biology. In its simplest form, it is tantamount to solving a linear system
of equations, for which the entries of the right hand side vector have been
permuted. This type of data corruption renders the linear regression task
considerably harder, even in the absence of other corruptions, such as noise,
outliers or missing entries. Existing methods are either applicable only to
noiseless data or they are very sensitive to initialization or they work only
for partially shuffled data. In this paper we address these issues via an
algebraic geometric approach, which uses symmetric polynomials to extract
permutation-invariant constraints that the parameters $\xi^* \in \Re^n$ of the
linear regression model must satisfy. This naturally leads to a polynomial
system of $n$ equations in $n$ unknowns, which contains $\xi^*$ in its root
locus. Using the machinery of algebraic geometry we prove that as long as the
independent samples are generic, this polynomial system is always consistent
with at most $n!$ complex roots, regardless of any type of corruption inflicted
on the observations. The algorithmic implication of this fact is that one can
always solve this polynomial system and use its most suitable root as

by cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM), we consider the problem of heterogeneous
multireference alignment of images. In this problem, the goal is to estimate a
(typically small) set of target images from a (typically large) collection of
observations. Each observation is a rotated, noisy version of one of the target
images. For each individual observation, neither the rotation nor which target
image has been rotated are known. As the noise level in cryo-EM data is high,
clustering the observations and estimating individual rotations is challenging.
We propose a framework to estimate the target images directly from the
observations, completely bypassing the need to cluster or register the images.
The framework consists of two steps. First, we estimate rotation-invariant
features of the images, such as the bispectrum. These features can be estimated
to any desired accuracy, at any noise level, provided sufficiently many
observations are collected. Then, we estimate the images from the invariant
features. Numerical experiments on synthetic cryo-EM datasets demonstrate the
effectiveness of the method. Ultimately, we outline future developments
required to apply this method to experimental data.","['Chao Ma', 'Tamir Bendory', 'Nicolas Boumal', 'Fred Sigworth', 'Amit Singer']","['eess.IV', 'stat.ML']",2018-10-12 02:50:21+00:00

(Lang et al., 2018) has shown that some popular approximation algorithms
perform very well when the input instance is stable. The simplest stability
condition assumes that the MAP solution does not change at all when some of the
pairwise potentials are (adversarially) perturbed. Unfortunately, this strong
condition does not seem to be satisfied in practice. In this paper, we
introduce a significantly more relaxed condition that only requires blocks
(portions) of an input instance to be stable. Under this block stability
condition, we prove that the pairwise LP relaxation is persistent on the stable
blocks. We complement our theoretical results with an empirical evaluation of
real-world MAP inference instances from computer vision. We design an algorithm
to find stable blocks, and find that these real instances have large stable

models in low-resource settings. A typical pruning algorithm is a three-stage
pipeline, i.e., training (a large model), pruning and fine-tuning. During
pruning, according to a certain criterion, redundant weights are pruned and
important weights are kept to best preserve the accuracy. In this work, we make
several surprising observations which contradict common beliefs. For all
state-of-the-art structured pruning algorithms we examined, fine-tuning a
pruned model only gives comparable or worse performance than training that
model with randomly initialized weights. For pruning algorithms which assume a
predefined target network architecture, one can get rid of the full pipeline
and directly train the target network from scratch. Our observations are
consistent for multiple network architectures, datasets, and tasks, which imply
that: 1) training a large, over-parameterized model is often not necessary to
obtain an efficient final model, 2) learned ""important"" weights of the large
model are typically not useful for the small pruned model, 3) the pruned
architecture itself, rather than a set of inherited ""important"" weights, is
more crucial to the efficiency in the final model, which suggests that in some
cases pruning can be useful as an architecture search paradigm. Our results
suggest the need for more careful baseline evaluations in future research on
structured pruning methods. We also compare with the ""Lottery Ticket
Hypothesis"" (Frankle & Carbin 2019), and find that with optimal learning rate,

To further improve the location performance, a joint phasor measurement units

significant aspect of our methodology is that under very low observability (7%
of buses), the algorithm is still able to localize the faulted line to a small

additional training samples for classifiers, thus making them more accurate and
robust. However, in anomaly detection GANs are only used to reconstruct
existing samples rather than to generate additional ones. This stems both from
the small amount and lack of diversity of anomalous data in most domains. In
this study we propose MDGAN, a novel GAN architecture for improving anomaly
detection through the generation of additional samples. Our approach uses two
discriminators: a dense network for determining whether the generated samples
are of sufficient quality (i.e., valid) and an autoencoder that serves as an
anomaly detector. MDGAN enables us to reconcile two conflicting goals: 1)
generate high-quality samples that can fool the first discriminator, and 2)
generate samples that can eventually be effectively reconstructed by the second
discriminator, thus improving its performance. Empirical evaluation on a

combination of resources, and returns different rewards for the resources
consumed. We consider a general model where the resource consumption
distribution associated with each (customer type, action)-combination is not
known, but is consistent and can be learned over time. In addition, the
sequence of customer types to arrive over time is arbitrary and completely
unknown.
  We overcome both the challenges of model uncertainty and customer
heterogeneity by judiciously synthesizing two algorithmic frameworks from the
literature: inventory balancing, which ""reserves"" a portion of each resource
for high-reward customer types which could later arrive, and online learning,
which shows how to ""explore"" the resource consumption distributions of each
customer type under different actions. We define an auxiliary problem, which
allows for existing competitive ratio and regret bounds to be seamlessly
integrated. Furthermore, we show that the performance guarantee generated by
our framework is tight, that is, we provide an information-theoretic lower
bound which shows that both the loss from competitive ratio and the loss for
regret are relevant in the combined problem.
  Finally, we demonstrate the efficacy of our algorithms on a publicly

no historical data (no fitted customer choice models, nor forecasting of
customer arrival patterns) and can be used to initialize allocation strategies

particular, we explore whether the training set should contain annotated app
reviews from those apps/app categories on which the model is subsequently
planned to be applied, or is it sufficient to have annotated app reviews from
any app available for training, even when these apps are from very different
categories compared to the test app. Our experiments show that having annotated

every point $p \in P$ has outgoing edges to its $k$ nearest neighbors, or is it
$\epsilon$-far from being a $k$-NN graph? Here, $\epsilon$-far means that one
has to change more than an $\epsilon$-fraction of the edges in order to make
$G$ a $k$-NN graph. We develop a randomized algorithm with one-sided error that

spatio-temporally invariant structures in the sensorimotor experience of an

a computational model of this mechanism through a sensorimotor, unsupervised

interaction of an artificial agent with its environment. We show how
spatio-temporally invariant structures in the environment induce regularities
in the sensorimotor experience of an agent, and how this agent, while building
a predictive model of its sensorimotor experience, can capture them as densely
connected subgraphs in a graph of sensory states connected by motor commands.
Our approach is focused on elementary mechanisms, and is illustrated with a set
of simple experiments in which an agent interacts with an environment. We show
how the agent can build an internal model of moving but spatio-temporally
invariant structures by performing a Spectral Clustering of the graph modeling
its overall sensorimotor experiences. We systematically examine properties of
the model, shedding light more globally on the specificities of the paradigm

prediction of future hospitalizations using real EHR data and compare its
predictive performance with baseline methods. Patient2Vec produces a vector

relevant features and estimate the model coefficients simultaneously and has
been widely used in many research areas such as genomes studies, finance, and
biomedical imaging. Despite its popularity, it is very challenging to guarantee
the feature selection consistency of Lasso especially when the dimension of the
data is huge. One way to improve the feature selection consistency is to select
an ideal tuning parameter. Traditional tuning criteria mainly focus on
minimizing the estimated prediction error or maximizing the posterior model
probability, such as cross-validation and BIC, which may either be
time-consuming or fail to control the false discovery rate (FDR) when the
number of features is extremely large. The other way is to introduce
pseudo-features to learn the importance of the original ones. Recently, the
Knockoff filter is proposed to control the FDR when performing feature
selection. However, its performance is sensitive to the choice of the expected
FDR threshold. Motivated by these ideas, we propose a new method using
pseudo-features to obtain an ideal tuning parameter. In particular, we present
the Efficient Tuning of Lasso (ET-Lasso) to separate active and inactive
features by adding permuted features as pseudo-features in linear models. The
pseudo-features are constructed to be inactive by nature, which can be used to
obtain a cutoff to select the tuning parameter that separates active and

Other astonishing results have been achieved using neural nets as data

One special application is the field of image domain translations. Here, the
goal is to take an image with a certain style (e.g. a photography) and
transform it into another one (e.g. a painting). If such a task is performed
for unpaired training examples, the corresponding GAN setting is complex, the
neural networks are large, and this leads to a high peak memory consumption
during, both, training and evaluation phase. This sets a limit to the highest
processable image size. We address this issue by the idea of not processing the
whole image at once, but to train and evaluate the domain translation on the
level of overlapping image subsamples. This new approach not only enables us to
translate high-resolution images that otherwise cannot be processed by the
neural network at once, but also allows us to work with comparably small neural
networks and with limited hardware resources. Additionally, the number of

records corresponding to different physical entities into different clusters.
  We introduce a framework which we call promise correlation clustering. Given
a complete graph $G$ with the edges labelled $0$ and $1$, the goal is to find a
clustering that minimizes the number of $0$ edges within a cluster plus the
number of $1$ edges across different clusters (or correlation loss). The
optimal clustering can also be viewed as a complete graph $G^*$ with edges
corresponding to points in the same cluster being labelled $0$ and other edges
being labelled $1$. Under the promise that the edge difference between $G$ and
$G^*$ is ""small"", we prove that finding the optimal clustering (or $G^*$) is
still NP-Hard. [Ashtiani et. al, 2016] introduced the framework of
semi-supervised clustering, where the learning algorithm has access to an
oracle, which answers whether two points belong to the same or different
clusters. We further prove that even with access to a same-cluster oracle, the
promise version is NP-Hard as long as the number queries to the oracle is not
too large ($o(n)$ where $n$ is the number of vertices).

optimization on its own. Moreover, we propose a simple heuristics to estimate
the Lipschitz constant, and prove that a growing estimate of the Lipschitz
constant is in some sense ``harmless''. Our experiments on 15 datasets with 4

universal $l_\infty$ first-order attack, and PGD adversarial training can
significantly improve network robustness against a wide range of first-order
$l_\infty$-bounded attacks, represented as the state-of-the-art defense method.
However, an obvious weakness of PGD adversarial training is its
highly-computational cost in generating adversarial samples, making it
computationally infeasible for large and high-resolution real datasets such as
the ImageNet dataset. In addition, recent work also has suggested a simple
""close-form"" solution to a robust model on MNIST. Therefore, a natural question
raised is that is PGD adversarial training really necessary for robust defense?
In this paper, we give a negative answer by proposing a training paradigm that
is comparable to PGD adversarial training on several standard datasets, while
only using noisy-natural samples. Specifically, we reformulate the min-max
objective in PGD adversarial training by a problem to minimize the original
network loss plus $l_1$ norms of its gradients w.r.t. the inputs. For the
$l_1$-norm loss, we propose a computationally-feasible solution by embedding a
differentiable soft-quantization layer after the network input layer. We show
formally that the soft-quantization layer trained with noisy-natural samples is
an alternative approach to minimizing the $l_1$-gradient norms as in PGD
adversarial training. Extensive empirical evaluations on standard datasets show
that our proposed models are comparable to PGD-adversarially-trained models
under PGD and BPDA attacks. Remarkably, our method achieves a 24X speed-up on
MNIST while maintaining a comparable defensive ability, and for the first time
fine-tunes a robust Imagenet model within only two days. Code is provided on

theoretical guarantees, the former may require a prohibitively large number of
features J+, and the latter may be prohibitively expensive for high-dimensional
problems. We propose to combine the simplicity and generality of RFMs with a
data-dependent feature selection scheme to achieve desirable theoretical
approximation properties of Nystrom with just O(log J+) features. Our key
insight is to begin with a large set of random features, then reduce them to a
small number of weighted features in a data-dependent, computationally
efficient way, while preserving the statistical guarantees of using the
original large set of features. We demonstrate the efficacy of our method with
theory and experiments--including on a data set with over 50 million
observations. In particular, we show that our method achieves small kernel
matrix approximation error and better test set accuracy with provably fewer
random features than state-of-the-art methods.","['Raj Agrawal', 'Trevor Campbell', 'Jonathan H. Huggins', 'Tamara Broderick']","['stat.ML', 'cs.LG']",2018-10-09 21:20:41+00:00
http://arxiv.org/abs/1810.04247v7,Feature Selection using Stochastic Gates,"Feature selection problems have been extensively studied for linear
estimation, for instance, Lasso, but less emphasis has been placed on feature
selection for non-linear functions. In this study, we propose a method for
feature selection in high-dimensional non-linear function estimation problems.
The new procedure is based on minimizing the $\ell_0$ norm of the vector of
indicator variables that represent if a feature is selected or not. Our
approach relies on the continuous relaxation of Bernoulli distributions, which
allows our model to learn the parameters of the approximate Bernoulli
distributions via gradient descent. This general framework simultaneously
minimizes a loss function while selecting relevant features. Furthermore, we
provide an information-theoretic justification of incorporating Bernoulli
distribution into our approach and demonstrate the potential of the approach on
synthetic and real-life applications.","['Yutaro Yamada', 'Ofir Lindenbaum', 'Sahand Negahban', 'Yuval Kluger']","['cs.LG', 'stat.ML']",2018-10-09 21:17:37+00:00
