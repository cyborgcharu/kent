http://arxiv.org/abs/1912.03321v1,Robust Deep Graph Based Learning for Binary Classification,"Convolutional neural network (CNN)-based feature learning has become state of
the art, since given sufficient training data, CNN can significantly outperform
traditional methods for various classification tasks. However, feature learning
becomes more difficult if some training labels are noisy. With traditional
regularization techniques, CNN often overfits to the noisy training labels,
resulting in sub-par classification performance. In this paper, we propose a
robust binary classifier, based on CNNs, to learn deep metric functions, which
are then used to construct an optimal underlying graph structure used to clean
noisy labels via graph Laplacian regularization (GLR). GLR is posed as a convex
maximum a posteriori (MAP) problem solved via convex quadratic programming
(QP). To penalize samples around the decision boundary, we propose two
regularized loss functions for semi-supervised learning. The binary
classification experiments on three datasets, varying in number and type of
features, demonstrate that given a noisy training dataset, our proposed
networks outperform several state-of-the-art classifiers, including label-noise
robust support vector machine, CNNs with three different robust loss functions,
model-based GLR, and dynamic graph CNN classifiers.","['Minxiang Ye', 'Vladimir Stankovic', 'Lina Stankovic', 'Gene Cheung']","['cs.LG', 'stat.ML']",2019-12-06 19:11:52+00:00

detection is very important to increase patient prognostics. However, the lack
of qualified professionals and medical instruments are significant issues in

we present an overview of the recent advances reported in this field as well as
a discussion about the challenges and opportunities for improvement in the
current models. In addition, we also present some important aspects regarding

http://arxiv.org/abs/1912.03277v3,Preserving Causal Constraints in Counterfactual Explanations for Machine Learning Classifiers,"To construct interpretable explanations that are consistent with the original
ML model, counterfactual examples---showing how the model's output changes with
small perturbations to the input---have been proposed. This paper extends the
work in counterfactual explanations by addressing the challenge of feasibility
of such examples. For explanations of ML models in critical domains such as
healthcare and finance, counterfactual examples are useful for an end-user only
to the extent that perturbation of feature inputs is feasible in the real
world. We formulate the problem of feasibility as preserving causal
relationships among input features and present a method that uses (partial)
structural causal models to generate actionable counterfactuals. When
feasibility constraints cannot be easily expressed, we consider an alternative
mechanism where people can label generated CF examples on feasibility: whether
it is feasible to intervene and realize the candidate CF example from the
original input. To learn from this labelled feasibility data, we propose a
modified variational auto encoder loss for generating CF examples that
optimizes for feasibility as people interact with its output. Our experiments
on Bayesian networks and the widely used ''Adult-Income'' dataset show that our
proposed methods can generate counterfactual explanations that better satisfy
feasibility constraints than existing methods.. Code repository can be accessed

standard class probabilities can be easily computed as well as unnormalized
values of p(x) and p(x|y). Within this framework, standard discriminative

We demonstrate that energy based training of the joint distribution improves
calibration, robustness, andout-of-distribution detection while also enabling
our models to generate samplesrivaling the quality of recent GAN approaches. We
improve upon recently proposed techniques for scaling up the training of energy

standard classification training. Our approach is the first to achieve
performance rivaling the state-of-the-artin both generative and discriminative
learning within one hybrid model.","['Will Grathwohl', 'Kuan-Chieh Wang', 'Jörn-Henrik Jacobsen', 'David Duvenaud', 'Mohammad Norouzi', 'Kevin Swersky']","['cs.LG', 'cs.CV', 'stat.ML']",2019-12-06 18:00:36+00:00

combines the low dimensional representation of autoencoders with the
flexibility of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). This framework can be
used to take in raw sensitive data and privately train a model for generating
synthetic data that will satisfy similar statistical properties as the original

which can then be freely shared due to the post-processing guarantee of
differential privacy. Our framework is applicable to unlabeled mixed-type data,
that may include binary, categorical, and real-valued data. We implement this

compare its performance with existing private algorithms on metrics in
unsupervised settings. We also introduce a new quantitative metric able to

prominent solutions to many computer vision tasks, the potential benefits of
utilizing correlations between frames have received less attention. Even though
probabilistic machine learning provides the ability to encode correlation as
prior knowledge for inference, there is a tangible gap between the theory and
practice of applying probabilistic methods to modern vision problems. For this,
we derive a principled framework to combine information coupling between camera
poses (translation and orientation) with deep models. We proposed a novel view
kernel that generalizes the standard periodic kernel in $\mathrm{SO}(3)$. We
show how this soft-prior knowledge can aid several pose-related vision tasks

generative models, pointing towards a range of new applications for inter-frame

visual dysfunction that persists beyond the acute incident. The etiology behind

These functional deficits may be caused by shear injury or micro-bleeds, which

assistants (VVA) is due to the emotional and personalized experience they
deliver, with humor being a key component in providing an engaging interaction.
In this paper we describe methods used to improve the joke skill of a VVA
through personalization. The first method, based on traditional NLP techniques,
is robust and scalable. The others combine self-attentional network and
multi-task learning to obtain better results, at the cost of added complexity.
A significant challenge facing these systems is the lack of explicit user
feedback needed to provide labels for the models. Instead, we explore the use
of two implicit feedback-based labelling strategies. All models were evaluated
on real production data. Online results show that models trained on any of the
considered labels outperform a heuristic method, presenting a positive
real-world impact on user satisfaction. Offline results suggest that the

http://arxiv.org/abs/1912.03221v2,Tree bark re-identification using a deep-learning feature descriptor,"The ability to visually re-identify objects is a fundamental capability in
vision systems. Oftentimes, it relies on collections of visual signatures based
on descriptors, such as SIFT or SURF. However, these traditional descriptors
were designed for a certain domain of surface appearances and geometries
(limited relief). Consequently, highly-textured surfaces such as tree bark pose
a challenge to them. In turn, this makes it more difficult to use trees as
identifiable landmarks for navigational purposes (robotics) or to track felled
lumber along a supply chain (logistics). We thus propose to use data-driven
descriptors trained on bark images for tree surface re-identification. To this
effect, we collected a large dataset containing 2,400 bark images with strong
illumination changes, annotated by surface and with the ability to pixel-align
them. We used this dataset to sample from more than 2 million 64x64 pixel
patches to train our novel local descriptors DeepBark and SqueezeBark. Our
DeepBark method has shown a clear advantage against the hand-crafted
descriptors SIFT and SURF. For instance, we demonstrated that DeepBark can
reach a mAP of 87.2% when retrieving 11 relevant bark images, i.e.
corresponding to the same physical surface, to a bark query against 7,900
images. Our work thus suggests that re-identifying tree surfaces in a
challenging illuminations context is possible. We also make public our dataset,
which can be used to benchmark surface re-identification techniques.","['Martin Robert', 'Patrick Dallaire', 'Philippe Giguère']","['cs.LG', 'cs.CV', 'stat.ML']",2019-12-06 16:43:02+00:00

http://arxiv.org/abs/1912.04174v1,Deep Bayesian Recurrent Neural Networks for Somatic Variant Calling in Cancer,"The emerging field of precision oncology relies on the accurate pinpointing
of alterations in the molecular profile of a tumor to provide personalized
targeted treatments. Current methodologies in the field commonly include the
application of next generation sequencing technologies to a tumor sample,
followed by the identification of mutations in the DNA known as somatic
variants. The differentiation of these variants from sequencing error poses a
classic classification problem, which has traditionally been approached with
Bayesian statistics, and more recently with supervised machine learning methods
such as neural networks. Although these methods provide greater accuracy,
classic neural networks lack the ability to indicate the confidence of a
variant call. In this paper, we explore the performance of deep Bayesian neural
networks on next generation sequencing data, and their ability to give
probability estimates for somatic variant calls. In addition to demonstrating
similar performance in comparison to standard neural networks, we show that the
resultant output probabilities make these better suited to the disparate and
highly-variable sequencing data-sets these models are likely to encounter in
the real world. We aim to deliver algorithms to oncologists for which model
certainty better reflects accuracy, for improved clinical application. By
moving away from point estimates to reliable confidence intervals, we expect
the resultant clinical and treatment decisions to be more robust and more
informed by the underlying reality of the tumor molecular profile.","['Geoffroy Dubourg-Felonneau', 'Omar Darwish', 'Christopher Parsons', 'Dami Rebergen', 'John W Cassidy', 'Nirmesh Patel', 'Harry W Clifford']","['cs.LG', 'q-bio.GN', 'stat.ML']",2019-12-06 16:01:15+00:00
http://arxiv.org/abs/1912.03193v1,Risk-Averse Trust Region Optimization for Reward-Volatility Reduction,"In real-world decision-making problems, for instance in the fields of
finance, robotics or autonomous driving, keeping uncertainty under control is
as important as maximizing expected returns. Risk aversion has been addressed
in the reinforcement learning literature through risk measures related to the
variance of returns. However, in many cases, the risk is measured not only on a
long-term perspective, but also on the step-wise rewards (e.g., in trading, to
ensure the stability of the investment bank, it is essential to monitor the
risk of portfolio positions on a daily basis). In this paper, we define a novel
measure of risk, which we call reward volatility, consisting of the variance of
the rewards under the state-occupancy measure. We show that the reward
volatility bounds the return variance so that reducing the former also
constrains the latter. We derive a policy gradient theorem with a new objective
function that exploits the mean-volatility relationship, and develop an
actor-only algorithm. Furthermore, thanks to the linearity of the Bellman
equations defined under the new objective function, it is possible to adapt the
well-known policy gradient algorithms with monotonic improvement guarantees
such as TRPO in a risk-averse manner. Finally, we test the proposed approach in
two simulated financial environments.","['Lorenzo Bisi', 'Luca Sabbioni', 'Edoardo Vittori', 'Matteo Papini', 'Marcello Restelli']","['cs.LG', 'math.OC', 'stat.ML']",2019-12-06 15:57:06+00:00
http://arxiv.org/abs/1912.03192v2,Achieving Robustness in the Wild via Adversarial Mixing with Disentangled Representations,"Recent research has made the surprising finding that state-of-the-art deep
learning models sometimes fail to generalize to small variations of the input.
Adversarial training has been shown to be an effective approach to overcome
this problem. However, its application has been limited to enforcing invariance
to analytically defined transformations like $\ell_p$-norm bounded
perturbations. Such perturbations do not necessarily cover plausible real-world
variations that preserve the semantics of the input (such as a change in
lighting conditions). In this paper, we propose a novel approach to express and
formalize robustness to these kinds of real-world transformations of the input.
The two key ideas underlying our formulation are (1) leveraging disentangled
representations of the input to define different factors of variations, and (2)
generating new input images by adversarially composing the representations of
different images. We use a StyleGAN model to demonstrate the efficacy of this
framework. Specifically, we leverage the disentangled latent representations
computed by a StyleGAN model to generate perturbations of an image that are
similar to real-world variations (like adding make-up, or changing the
skin-tone of a person) and train models to be invariant to these perturbations.
Extensive experiments show that our method improves generalization and reduces
the effect of spurious correlations (reducing the error rate of a ""smile""

recognition in a setting which resembles that under whichhumans see and learn.
This setting has a set of unique characteristics:it assumes an egocentric
point-of-view bound to the needs of a singleperson, which implies a relatively
low diversity of data and a coldstart with no data; it requires to operate in
an open world, where newobjects can be encounteredat any time; supervision is
scarce and hasto be solicited to the user, and completelyunsupervised
recognitionof new objects should be possible. Note that this setting differs
fromthe one addressed in the open world recognition literature, where
supervised feedback is always requested to be able to incorporate newobjects.
We propose a first solution to this problem in the form ofa memory-based
incremental framework that is capable of storinginformation of each and any
object it encounters, while using the supervision of the user to learn to
discriminate between known and unknown objects. Our approach is based on four
main features: the useof time and space persistence (i.e., the appearance of
objects changesrelatively slowly), the use of similarity as the main driving
principlefor object recognition and novelty detection, the progressive
introduction of new objects in a developmental fashion and the
selectiveelicitation of user feedback in an online active learning fashion.
Experimental results show the feasibility of open world, generic
objectrecognition, the ability to recognize, memorize and re-identify
newobjects even in complete absence of user supervision, and the utilityof
persistence and incrementality in boosting performance.","['Luca Erculiani', 'Fausto Giunchiglia', 'Andrea Passerini']","['cs.CV', 'cs.LG', 'stat.ML']",2019-12-06 12:10:59+00:00

attention mechanism in hyperbolic spaces at the first attempt. The research of
hyperbolic GNN has some unique challenges: since the hyperbolic spaces are not
vector spaces, the vector operations (e.g., vector addition, subtraction, and
scalar multiplication) cannot be carried. To tackle this problem, we employ the
gyrovector spaces, which provide an elegant algebraic formalism for hyperbolic
geometry, to transform the features in a graph; and then we propose the
hyperbolic proximity based attention mechanism to aggregate the features.
Moreover, as mathematical operations in hyperbolic spaces could be more
complicated than those in Euclidean spaces, we further devise a novel

cardiovascular diseases and respiratory diseases, may have connection with long
exposure to highly polluted environment. Therefore, accurate air quality
forecasts are extremely important to those who are vulnerable. To estimate the
variation of several air pollution concentrations, previous researchers used
various approaches, such as the Community Multiscale Air Quality model (CMAQ)
or neural networks. Although CMAQ model considers a coverage of the historic
air pollution data and meteorological variables, extra bias is introduced due
to additional adjustment. In this paper, a combination of model-based strategy
and data-driven method namely the physical-temporal collection(PTC) model is
proposed, aiming to fix the systematic error that traditional models deliver.
In the data-driven part, the first components are the temporal pattern and the
weather pattern to measure important features that contribute to the prediction
performance. The less relevant input variables will be removed to eliminate
negative weights in network training. Then, we deploy a long-short-term-memory

initial parameters and the target function, through the following research
line. We first estimate \emph{a priori} generalization error of finite-width
two-layer ReLU NN with constraint of minimal norm solution, which is proved by
\cite{zhang2019type} to be an equivalent solution of a linearized (w.r.t.
parameter) finite-width two-layer NN. As the width goes to infinity, the
linearized NN converges to the NN in Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) regime

error of two-layer ReLU NN in NTK regime. The distance between NN in a NTK
regime and a finite-width NN with gradient training is estimated by
\cite{arora2019exact}. Based on the results in \cite{arora2019exact}, our work
proves an \emph{a priori} generalization error bound of two-layer ReLU NNs.
This estimate uses the intrinsic implicit bias of the minimum norm solution
without requiring extra regularity in the loss function. This \emph{a priori}
estimate also implies that NN does not suffer from curse of dimensionality, and
a small generalization error can be achieved without requiring exponentially
large number of neurons. In addition the research line proposed in this paper

behavior. Then we collect a massive number of possible region-wise indicators

component analysis (PCA). Furthermore, we model the international flow of
migration and trade as a convolution on regional influenza activity, and solve
the deconvolution problem as higher-order perturbations to the linear
regression, thus separating regional and international factors related to the
influenza mortality. Finally, both the original model and the perturbed model
are tested on regional examples, as validations of our models. Pertaining to
the policy, we make a proposal based on the connectivity data along with the

to use knowledge from an approximate model such as its simulator. However, how

unknown model? Despite numerous empirical studies of transfer reinforcement
learning, an answer to this question is still elusive. In this paper, we study
the sample complexity of RL while an approximate model of the environment is
provided. For an unknown Markov decision process (MDP), we show that the
approximate model can effectively reduce the complexity by eliminating
sub-optimal actions from the policy searching space. In particular, we provide
an algorithm that uses $\widetilde{O}(N/(1-\gamma)^3/\varepsilon^2)$ samples in
a generative model to learn an $\varepsilon$-optimal policy, where $\gamma$ is
the discount factor and $N$ is the number of near-optimal actions in the
approximate model. This can be much smaller than the learning-from-scratch
complexity $\widetilde{\Theta}(SA/(1-\gamma)^3/\varepsilon^2)$, where $S$ and
$A$ are the sizes of state and action spaces respectively. We also provide a
lower bound showing that the above upper bound is nearly-tight if the value gap
between near-optimal actions and sub-optimal actions in the approximate model

the loss function that consists of the governing equations residuals in

reducing the amount of \emph{additional} noise required to achieve a given
privacy guarantee. We conduct a large-scale empirical study to examine this
question. Training a grid of over 120,000 models across four datasets (tabular
and images) on convex and non-convex objectives, we demonstrate that the random
seed has a larger impact on model weights than any individual training example.
We test the distribution over weights induced by the seed, finding that the
simple convex case can be modelled with a multivariate Gaussian posterior,
while neural networks exhibit multi-modal and non-Gaussian weight
distributions. By casting convex SGD as a Gaussian mechanism, we then estimate
an `intrinsic' data-dependent $\epsilon_i(\mathcal{D})$, finding values as low
as 6.3, dropping to 1.9 using empirical estimates. We use a membership
inference attack to estimate $\epsilon$ for non-convex SGD and demonstrate that
hiding the random seed from the adversary results in a statistically
significant reduction in attack performance, corresponding to a reduction in
the effective $\epsilon$. These results provide empirical evidence that SGD

unsafe states. The user knows the rewards and unsafe states, but querying the
user is expensive. To address this challenge, we propose an algorithm that
safely and interactively learns a model of the user's reward function. We start
with a generative model of initial states and a forward dynamics model trained
on off-policy data. Our method uses these models to synthesize hypothetical
behaviors, asks the user to label the behaviors with rewards, and trains a
neural network to predict the rewards. The key idea is to actively synthesize
the hypothetical behaviors from scratch by maximizing tractable proxies for the
value of information, without interacting with the environment. We call this
method reward query synthesis via trajectory optimization (ReQueST). We
evaluate ReQueST with simulated users on a state-based 2D navigation task and
the image-based Car Racing video game. The results show that ReQueST
significantly outperforms prior methods in learning reward models that transfer
to new environments with different initial state distributions. Moreover,
ReQueST safely trains the reward model to detect unsafe states, and corrects
reward hacking before deploying the agent.","['Siddharth Reddy', 'Anca D. Dragan', 'Sergey Levine', 'Shane Legg', 'Jan Leike']","['cs.CY', 'cs.LG', 'stat.ML']",2019-12-05 18:25:48+00:00

attacks. Specifically, by injecting a small number of maliciously constructed
inputs into the training set, an adversary is able to plant a backdoor into the
trained model. This backdoor can then be activated during inference by a
backdoor trigger to fully control the model's behavior. While such attacks are
very effective, they crucially rely on the adversary injecting arbitrary inputs
that are---often blatantly---mislabeled. Such samples would raise suspicion
upon human inspection, potentially revealing the attack. Thus, for backdoor
attacks to remain undetected, it is crucial that they maintain
label-consistency---the condition that injected inputs are consistent with
their labels. In this work, we leverage adversarial perturbations and
generative models to execute efficient, yet label-consistent, backdoor attacks.
Our approach is based on injecting inputs that appear plausible, yet are hard
to classify, hence causing the model to rely on the (easier-to-learn) backdoor
trigger.","['Alexander Turner', 'Dimitris Tsipras', 'Aleksander Madry']","['stat.ML', 'cs.CR', 'cs.LG']",2019-12-05 18:05:59+00:00

models that compactly represent deeply factored and mixed distributions. An SPN
is a rooted directed acyclic graph (DAG) consisting of a set of leaves
(corresponding to base distributions), a set of sum nodes (which represent
mixtures of their children distributions) and a set of product nodes
(representing the products of its children distributions).
  In this work, we initiate the study of the sample complexity of PAC-learning
the set of distributions that correspond to SPNs. We show that the sample
complexity of learning tree structured SPNs with the usual type of leaves
(i.e., Gaussian or discrete) grows at most linearly (up to logarithmic factors)
with the number of parameters of the SPN. More specifically, we show that the
class of distributions that corresponds to tree structured Gaussian SPNs with
$k$ mixing weights and $e$ ($d$-dimensional Gaussian) leaves can be learned
within Total Variation error $\epsilon$ using at most
$\widetilde{O}(\frac{ed^2+k}{\epsilon^2})$ samples. A similar result holds for
tree structured SPNs with discrete leaves.
  We obtain the upper bounds based on the recently proposed notion of
distribution compression schemes. More specifically, we show that if a (base)
class of distributions $\mathcal{F}$ admits an ""efficient"" compression, then
the class of tree structured SPNs with leaves from $\mathcal{F}$ also admits an
efficient compression.","['Ishaq Aden-Ali', 'Hassan Ashtiani']","['cs.LG', 'math.ST', 'stat.ML', 'stat.TH']",2019-12-05 17:57:58+00:00

improving accuracy, uncertainty and out-of-distribution robustness of deep
learning models. While deep ensembles were theoretically motivated by the
bootstrap, non-bootstrap ensembles trained with just random initialization also
perform well in practice, which suggests that there could be other explanations
for why deep ensembles work well. Bayesian neural networks, which learn
distributions over the parameters of the network, are theoretically
well-motivated by Bayesian principles, but do not perform as well as deep
ensembles in practice, particularly under dataset shift. One possible
explanation for this gap between theory and practice is that popular scalable
variational Bayesian methods tend to focus on a single mode, whereas deep
ensembles tend to explore diverse modes in function space. We investigate this
hypothesis by building on recent work on understanding the loss landscape of
neural networks and adding our own exploration to measure the similarity of
functions in the space of predictions. Our results show that random
initializations explore entirely different modes, while functions along an
optimization trajectory or sampled from the subspace thereof cluster within a
single mode predictions-wise, while often deviating significantly in the weight
space. Developing the concept of the diversity--accuracy plane, we show that
the decorrelation power of random initializations is unmatched by popular
subspace sampling methods. Finally, we evaluate the relative effects of

for sparse Gaussian process regression (SGPR) models. In contrast to existing
GP kernel selection algorithms that aim to select only one kernel with the
highest model evidence, our proposed VBKS algorithm considers the kernel as a
random variable and learns its belief from data such that the uncertainty of
the kernel can be interpreted and exploited to avoid overconfident GP
predictions. To achieve this, we represent the probabilistic kernel as an
additional variational variable in a variational inference (VI) framework for
SGPR models where its posterior belief is learned together with that of the
other variational variables (i.e., inducing variables and kernel
hyperparameters). In particular, we transform the discrete kernel belief into a
continuous parametric distribution via reparameterization in order to apply VI.
Though it is computationally challenging to jointly optimize a large number of
hyperparameters due to many kernels being evaluated simultaneously by our VBKS
algorithm, we show that the variational lower bound of the log-marginal
likelihood can be decomposed into an additive form such that each additive term
depends only on a disjoint subset of the variational variables and can thus be
optimized independently. Stochastic optimization is then used to maximize the
variational lower bound by iteratively improving the variational approximation
of the exact posterior belief via stochastic gradient ascent, which incurs
constant time per iteration and hence scales to big data. We empirically
evaluate the performance of our VBKS algorithm on synthetic and massive

combining a conditional Generative Adversarial Network (cGAN) for image

problems, but fails when the stationary assumption made on the objective
function is strongly violated, which is the case in particular for
ill-conditioned or discontinuous objectives. We tackle this problem by
proposing a new Bayesian optimisation framework that only considers the
ordering of variables, both in the input and output spaces, to fit a Gaussian
process in a latent space. By doing so, our approach is agnostic to the
original metrics on the original spaces. We propose two algorithms,

optimistic strategy we prove an optimal performance under the measure of regret

minimizer is close to one of the target solutions and every saddle point
exhibits negative curvature. This discovery enables the development of
guaranteed global optimization methods using simple initializations. For both
problems, we show the nonconvex objectives have benign geometric structures --
every local minimizer is close to one of the target solutions and every saddle
point exhibits negative curvature -- either in the entire space or within a

last few years, and several organizations, researchers and social media

media users are still affected by hate speech. The problem is even more

In this work, we focus on countering hate speech that is targeted to

assembled a definition of hate speech, taking into account the journalistic
point of view and the types of hate speech that are usually targeted against
journalists. We then compile a large pool of tweets referring to
journalism-related accounts in multiple languages. In order to annotate the
pool of unlabeled tweets according to the definition, we follow a concise
annotation strategy that involves active learning annotation stages. The
outcome of this paper is a novel, publicly available collection of Twitter

state-of-the-art deep learning architectures for hate speech detection and use
our annotated datasets to train and evaluate them. Finally, we propose an

specifically, time-series clustering, the most important aspects are the
similarity measure used and the algorithm employed to conduct the clustering.
In this paper, a new similarity measure for time-series clustering is developed
based on a combination of a simple representation of time-series, slope of each
segment of time-series, Euclidean distance and the so-called dynamic time
warping. It is proved in this paper that the proposed distance measure is
metric and thus indexing can be applied. For the task of clustering, the
Particle Swarm Optimization algorithm is employed. The proposed similarity

solutions on complex continuous domains. While quality diver-sity (QD)
algorithms like Novelty Search with Local Competition (NSLC) and MAP-Elites are
designed to generate a diverse range of solutions, these algorithms require a
large number of evaluations for exploration of continuous spaces. Meanwhile,
variants of the Covariance Matrix Adaptation Evolution Strategy (CMA-ES) are
among the best-performing derivative-free optimizers in single-objective
continuous domains. This paper proposes a new QD algorithm called Covariance
Matrix Adaptation MAP-Elites (CMA-ME). Our new algorithm combines the
self-adaptation techniques of CMA-ES with archiving and mapping techniques for
maintaining diversity in QD. Results from experiments based on standard
continuous optimization benchmarks show that CMA-ME finds better-quality
solutions than MAP-Elites; similarly, results on the strategic game Hearthstone
show that CMA-ME finds both a higher overall quality and broader diversity of
strategies than both CMA-ES and MAP-Elites. Overall, CMA-ME more than doubles
the performance of MAP-Elites using standard QD performance metrics. These

to as the Kronecker product approximation (KoPA). Because the Kronecker product
is an extension of the outer product from vectors to matrices, KoPA extends the
low rank matrix approximation, and includes it as a special case. Comparing
with the latter, KoPA also offers a greater flexibility, since it allows the
user to choose the configuration, which are the dimensions of the two smaller
matrices forming the Kronecker product. On the other hand, the configuration to
be used is usually unknown, and needs to be determined from the data in order
to achieve the optimal balance between accuracy and parsimony. We propose to
use extended information criteria to select the configuration. Under the
paradigm of high dimensional analysis, we show that the proposed procedure is
able to select the true configuration with probability tending to one, under
