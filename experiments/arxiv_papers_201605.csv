http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.07845v1,Robust and scalable Bayesian analysis of spatial neural tuning function data,"A common analytical problem in neuroscience is the interpretation of neural
activity with respect to sensory input or behavioral output. This is typically
achieved by regressing measured neural activity against known stimuli or
behavioral variables to produce a ""tuning function"" for each neuron.
Unfortunately, because this approach handles neurons individually, it cannot
take advantage of simultaneous measurements from spatially adjacent neurons
that often have similar tuning properties. On the other hand, sharing
information between adjacent neurons can errantly degrade estimates of tuning
functions across space if there are sharp discontinuities in tuning between
nearby neurons. In this paper, we develop a computationally efficient block
Gibbs sampler that effectively pools information between neurons to de-noise
tuning function estimates while simultaneously preserving sharp discontinuities
that might exist in the organization of tuning across space. This method is
fully Bayesian and its computational cost per iteration scales
sub-quadratically with total parameter dimensionality. We demonstrate the
robustness and scalability of this approach by applying it to both real and
synthetic datasets. In particular, an application to data from the spinal cord
illustrates that the proposed methods can dramatically decrease the
experimental time required to accurately estimate tuning functions.","['Kamiar Rahnama Rad', 'Timothy A. Machado', 'Liam Paninski']","['stat.CO', 'stat.ML']",2016-06-24 22:15:19+00:00

which each observation is a finite mixture of an set of latent groups and the
mixture proportions (i.e., group probabilities) are drawn randomly. Each group
is associated with some distributions over a finite set of outcomes. Moreover,
as time evolves, the structure of these groups also changes; we model the
change in the group structure by a hidden Markov model (HMM) with a fixed
transition probability. We present an efficient inference method based on

ourselves in the framework of policy search algorithms, that are usually
designed to maximize the mean value, and derive a method that minimizes the
residual $\|T_* v_\pi - v_\pi\|_{1,\nu}$ over policies. A theoretical analysis
shows how good this proxy is to policy optimization, and notably that it is
better than its value-based counterpart. We also propose experiments on
randomly generated generic Markov decision processes, specifically designed for
studying the influence of the involved concentrability coefficient. They show
that the Bellman residual is generally a bad proxy to policy optimization and
that directly maximizing the mean value is much better, despite the current
lack of deep theoretical analysis. This might seem obvious, as directly
addressing the problem of interest is usually better, but given the prevalence
of (projected) Bellman residual minimization in value-based reinforcement
learning, we believe that this question is worth to be considered.","['Matthieu Geist', 'Bilal Piot', 'Olivier Pietquin']","['cs.LG', 'stat.ML']",2016-06-24 10:54:41+00:00

Ordinal constraints like this often come from human judgments. To account for

this problem. First, we derive prediction error bounds for ordinal embedding

sparse features of many natural signals. However, universal guarantees of the
stability of such features in the presence of noise are lacking. Here, we
provide very general conditions guaranteeing when dictionaries yielding the
sparsest encodings are unique and stable with respect to measurement or
modeling error. We demonstrate that some or all original dictionary elements
are recoverable from noisy data even if the dictionary fails to satisfy the
spark condition, its size is overestimated, or only a polynomial number of
distinct sparse supports appear in the data. Importantly, we derive these
guarantees without requiring any constraints on the recovered dictionary beyond
a natural upper bound on its size. Our results also yield an effective
procedure sufficient to affirm if a proposed solution to the dictionary
learning problem is unique within bounds commensurate with the noise. We

definition of joint (time-vertex) stationarity, which generalizes the classical
definition of time stationarity and the more recent definition appropriate for
graphs. Joint stationarity gives rise to a scalable Wiener optimization

to use various ""group sparsity-inducing"" norms such as the Group LASSO norm for
this purpose. By using the theory of convex relaxations, we show that it is
also possible to use $\ell_1$-norm minimization for group sparse recovery. We
introduce a new concept called group robust null space property (GRNSP), and
show that, under suitable conditions, a group version of the restricted

recovery. When all groups are of equal size, our bounds are less conservative

the groups have different sizes. When specialized to conventional sparsity, our
bounds reduce to one of the well-known ""best possible"" conditions for sparse
recovery. This relationship between GRNSP and GRIP is new even for conventional
sparsity, and substantially streamlines the proofs of some known results. Using
this relationship, we derive bounds on the $\ell_p$-norm of the residual error

problem is to minimize the (pseudo) regret which is the difference between the
total expected loss of the algorithm and the total expected loss of the best
fixed vector in hindsight. In this paper, we consider settings where the
unknown parameter has structure, e.g., sparse, group sparse, low-rank, which
can be captured by a norm, e.g., $L_1$, $L_{(1,2)}$, nuclear norm. We focus on
constructing confidence ellipsoids which contain the unknown parameter across
all rounds with high-probability. We show the radius of such ellipsoids depend
on the Gaussian width of sets associated with the norm capturing the structure.
Such characterization leads to tighter confidence ellipsoids and, therefore,
sharper regret bounds compared to bounds in the existing literature which are
based on the ambient dimensionality.","['Nicholas Johnson', 'Vidyashankar Sivakumar', 'Arindam Banerjee']","['stat.ML', 'cs.LG']",2016-06-17 22:31:01+00:00

towards a larger or smaller number of clusters which is monotonic (directly or
inversely) in the number of clusters in candidate partitions. This type of bias
is caused by the functional form of the CVI model. For example, the popular
Rand index (RI) exhibits a monotone increasing (NCinc) bias, while the Jaccard
Index (JI) index suffers from a monotone decreasing (NCdec) bias. This type of
bias has been previously recognized in the literature. In this work, we
identify a new type of bias arising from the distribution of the ground truth
(reference) partition against which candidate partitions are compared. We call
this new type of bias ground truth (GT) bias. This type of bias occurs if a
change in the reference partition causes a change in the bias status (e.g.,
NCinc, NCdec) of a CVI. For example, NCinc bias in the RI can be changed to
NCdec bias by skewing the distribution of clusters in the ground truth
partition. It is important for users to be aware of this new type of biased
behaviour, since it may affect the interpretations of CVI results. The
objective of this article is to study the empirical and theoretical
implications of GT bias. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first

Money"" platforms that deliver basic financial services over the mobile phone
network. While many believe that these services can improve the lives of the
poor, a consistent difficulty has been identifying individuals most likely to
benefit from access to the new technology. Here, we combine terabyte-scale data
from three different mobile phone operators from Ghana, Pakistan, and Zambia,
to better understand the behavioral determinants of mobile money adoption. Our
supervised learning models provide insight into the best predictors of adoption
in three very distinct cultures. We find that models fit on one population fail
to generalize to another, and in general are highly context-dependent. These
findings highlight the need for a nuanced approach to understanding the role
and potential of financial services for the poor.","['Muhammad Raza Khan', 'Joshua E. Blumenstock']","['stat.ML', 'cs.CY']",2016-06-16 09:21:55+00:00
http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.05060v1,Pruning Random Forests for Prediction on a Budget,"We propose to prune a random forest (RF) for resource-constrained prediction.
We first construct a RF and then prune it to optimize expected feature cost &
accuracy. We pose pruning RFs as a novel 0-1 integer program with linear
constraints that encourages feature re-use. We establish total unimodularity of
the constraint set to prove that the corresponding LP relaxation solves the
original integer program. We then exploit connections to combinatorial
optimization and develop an efficient primal-dual algorithm, scalable to large
datasets. In contrast to our bottom-up approach, which benefits from good RF
initialization, conventional methods are top-down acquiring features based on
their utility value and is generally intractable, requiring heuristics.
Empirically, our pruning algorithm outperforms existing state-of-the-art
resource-constrained algorithms.","['Feng Nan', 'Joseph Wang', 'Venkatesh Saligrama']","['stat.ML', 'cs.LG']",2016-06-16 05:56:36+00:00

consider interventions that are narrowly focused (impacting few covariates) and
may be tailored to each individual or globally enacted over a population. For
applications where harmful intervention is drastically worse than proposing no
change, we propose a conservative definition of the optimal intervention.
Assuming the underlying relationship remains invariant under intervention, we
develop efficient algorithms to identify the optimal intervention policy from
limited data and provide theoretical guarantees for our approach in a Gaussian
Process setting. Although our methods assume covariates can be precisely
adjusted, they remain capable of improving outcomes in misspecified settings
where interventions incur unintentional downstream effects. Empirically, our
approach identifies good interventions in two practical applications: gene
perturbation and writing improvement.","['Jonas Mueller', 'David N. Reshef', 'George Du', 'Tommi Jaakkola']","['stat.ML', 'cs.LG']",2016-06-16 01:55:33+00:00

improvements on data acquisition and analysis. In this paper we address these
concerns by using consumers' electrical smart meter readings to estimate
network loading and this information can then be used for better capacity
planning. We compare Deep Neural Network (DNN) methods with traditional methods
for load forecasting. Our results indicate that DNN methods outperform most

the reported data in both time and space to efficiently design the data
compression using the compressed sensing (CS) technique and theMAC protocol so
that the reported data can be recovered reliably within minimum reporting time.
Specifically, we perform the following design tasks: i) we employ the
two-dimensional (2D) CS technique to compress the reported data in the
distributed manner; ii) we propose to adapt the 802.15.4 MAC protocol frame
structure to enable efficient data transmission and reliable data
reconstruction; and iii) we develop an analytical model based on which we can

training examples and the dimension of the feature vectors, are large. To solve
these problems we propose the random parallel stochastic algorithm (RAPSA). We
call the algorithm random parallel because it utilizes multiple parallel
processors to operate on a randomly chosen subset of blocks of the feature
vector. We call the algorithm stochastic because processors choose training
subsets uniformly at random. Algorithms that are parallel in either of these
dimensions exist, but RAPSA is the first attempt at a methodology that is
parallel in both the selection of blocks and the selection of elements of the
training set. In RAPSA, processors utilize the randomly chosen functions to
compute the stochastic gradient component associated with a randomly chosen
block. The technical contribution of this paper is to show that this minimally
coordinated algorithm converges to the optimal classifier when the training
objective is convex. Moreover, we present an accelerated version of RAPSA
(ARAPSA) that incorporates the objective function curvature information by
premultiplying the descent direction by a Hessian approximation matrix. We
further extend the results for asynchronous settings and show that if the
processors perform their updates without any coordination the algorithms are
still convergent to the optimal argument. RAPSA and its extensions are then
numerically evaluated on a linear estimation problem and a binary image
classification task using the MNIST handwritten digit dataset.","['Aryan Mokhtari', 'Alec Koppel', 'Alejandro Ribeiro']","['cs.LG', 'math.OC', 'stat.ML']",2016-06-15 21:34:46+00:00

information to improve accuracy. One of the most popular way to integrate such
information is to extract hierarchical features from a multiscale segmentation.
In the classification context, the extracted features are commonly concatenated
into a long vector (also called stacked vector), on which is applied a
conventional vector-based machine learning technique (e.g. SVM with Gaussian
kernel). In this paper, we rather propose to use a sequence structured kernel:
the spectrum kernel. We show that the conventional stacked vector-based kernel
is actually a special case of this kernel. Experiments conducted on various
publicly available hyperspectral datasets illustrate the improvement of the
proposed kernel w.r.t. conventional ones using the same hierarchical spatial
features.","['Yanwei Cui', 'Laetitia Chapel', 'S√©bastien Lef√®vre']","['cs.CV', 'cs.LG', 'stat.ML']",2016-06-15 21:19:54+00:00

proposed flow consists of a chain of invertible transformations, where each
transformation is based on an autoregressive neural network. In experiments, we
show that IAF significantly improves upon diagonal Gaussian approximate

stochastic gradient (SG) method has traditionally played a central role while
conventional gradient-based nonlinear optimization techniques typically falter.
Based on this viewpoint, we present a comprehensive theory of a
straightforward, yet versatile SG algorithm, discuss its practical behavior,

accept arbitrary short term loss for long term gain. This is infeasible for
safety critical applications, such as robotics, where even a single unsafe
action may cause system failure. In this paper, we address the problem of
safely exploring finite Markov decision processes (MDP). We define safety in
terms of an, a priori unknown, safety constraint that depends on states and
actions. We aim to explore the MDP under this constraint, assuming that the
unknown function satisfies regularity conditions expressed via a Gaussian
process prior. We develop a novel algorithm for this task and prove that it is
able to completely explore the safely reachable part of the MDP without
violating the safety constraint. To achieve this, it cautiously explores safe
states and actions in order to gain statistical confidence about the safety of
unvisited state-action pairs from noisy observations collected while navigating
the environment. Moreover, the algorithm explicitly considers reachability when
exploring the MDP, ensuring that it does not get stuck in any state with no
safe way out. We demonstrate our method on digital terrain models for the task
