http://arxiv.org/abs/1805.05857v4,Glassy nature of the hard phase in inference problems,"An algorithmically hard phase was described in a range of inference problems:
even if the signal can be reconstructed with a small error from an information
theoretic point of view, known algorithms fail unless the noise-to-signal ratio
is sufficiently small. This hard phase is typically understood as a metastable
branch of the dynamical evolution of message passing algorithms. In this work
we study the metastable branch for a prototypical inference problem, the
low-rank matrix factorization, that presents a hard phase. We show that for
noise-to-signal ratios that are below the information theoretic threshold, the
posterior measure is composed of an exponential number of metastable glassy
states and we compute their entropy, called the complexity. We show that this
glassiness extends even slightly below the algorithmic threshold below which
the well-known approximate message passing (AMP) algorithm is able to closely
reconstruct the signal. Counter-intuitively, we find that the performance of
the AMP algorithm is not improved by taking into account the glassy nature of
the hard phase. This result provides further evidence that the hard phase in
inference problems is algorithmically impenetrable for some deep computational
reasons that remain to be uncovered.","['Fabrizio Antenucci', 'Silvio Franz', 'Pierfrancesco Urbani', 'Lenka Zdeborov√°']","['cond-mat.dis-nn', 'cond-mat.stat-mech', 'cs.IT', 'math.IT', 'math.ST', 'stat.ML', 'stat.TH']",2018-05-15 15:39:36+00:00

training Machine Learning (ML) models from large-scale user data collected on
personal devices (e.g., smartphones) without their raw data leaving the device.
At the core of FL is a network of anonymous user devices sharing training
information (model parameter updates) computed locally on personal data.
However, the type and degree to which user-specific information is encoded in
the model updates is poorly understood. In this paper, we identify model
updates encode subtle variations in which users capture and generate data. The
variations provide a strong statistical signal, allowing an adversary to
effectively deanonymize participating devices using a limited set of auxiliary
data. We analyze resulting deanonymization attacks on diverse tasks on
real-world (anonymized) user-generated data across a range of closed- and
open-world scenarios. We study various strategies to mitigate the risks of
deanonymization. As random perturbation methods do not offer convincing
operating points, we propose data-augmentation strategies which introduces
adversarial biases in device data and thereby, offer substantial protection
against deanonymization threats with little effect on utility.","['Tribhuvanesh Orekondy', 'Seong Joon Oh', 'Yang Zhang', 'Bernt Schiele', 'Mario Fritz']","['cs.CR', 'cs.AI', 'cs.CV', 'cs.LG', 'stat.ML']",2018-05-15 15:12:45+00:00

recognition, where the utterances of multiple speakers are recognized from
their mixture. Promising techniques have been proposed for this task, but
earlier works have required additional training data such as isolated source
signals or senone alignments for effective learning. In this paper, we propose
a new sequence-to-sequence framework to directly decode multiple label
sequences from a single speech sequence by unifying source separation and
speech recognition functions in an end-to-end manner. We further propose a new
objective function to improve the contrast between the hidden vectors to avoid
generating similar hypotheses. Experimental results show that the model is
directly able to learn a mapping from a speech mixture to multiple label
sequences, achieving 83.1 % relative improvement compared to a model trained
without the proposed objective. Interestingly, the results are comparable to
those produced by previous end-to-end works featuring explicit separation and
recognition modules.","['Hiroshi Seki', 'Takaaki Hori', 'Shinji Watanabe', 'Jonathan Le Roux', 'John R. Hershey']","['cs.SD', 'cs.CL', 'eess.AS', 'stat.ML']",2018-05-15 14:45:33+00:00

foundation of modern similarity based search. While much effort has been put in
developing algorithms for learning binary hamming code representations for
search efficiency, this still requires a linear scan of the entire dataset per
each query and trades off the search accuracy through binarization. To this
end, we consider the problem of directly learning a quantizable embedding
representation and the sparse binary hash code end-to-end which can be used to
construct an efficient hash table not only providing significant search
reduction in the number of data but also achieving the state of the art search
accuracy outperforming previous state of the art deep metric learning methods.
We also show that finding the optimal sparse binary hash code in a mini-batch
can be computed exactly in polynomial time by solving a minimum cost flow

the art search accuracy in precision@k and NMI metrics while providing up to

our model can be seen as a hierarchical RL algorithm that learns a posterior

the knowledge of a trained network for improving the learning process of a new
one, but finding a good technique for knowledge distillation is still an open
problem. In this paper, we provide a new perspective based on a decision
boundary, which is one of the most important component of a classifier. The
generalization performance of a classifier is closely related to the adequacy
of its decision boundary, so a good classifier bears a good decision boundary.
Therefore, transferring information closely related to the decision boundary
can be a good attempt for knowledge distillation. To realize this goal, we
utilize an adversarial attack to discover samples supporting a decision
boundary. Based on this idea, to transfer more accurate information about the
decision boundary, the proposed algorithm trains a student classifier based on
the adversarial samples supporting the decision boundary. Experiments show that
the proposed method indeed improves knowledge distillation and achieves the
state-of-the-arts performance.","['Byeongho Heo', 'Minsik Lee', 'Sangdoo Yun', 'Jin Young Choi']","['cs.LG', 'cs.CV', 'stat.ML']",2018-05-15 02:42:40+00:00

dimensionality reduction, with documented merits in diverse tasks involving
high-dimensional data. Standard PCA copes with one dataset at a time, but it is
challenged when it comes to analyzing multiple datasets jointly. In certain

to the target data relative to background data. To account for nonlinear data
correlations, (linear) dPCA models for one or multiple background datasets are

great promise, due to a powerful combination of massive adoption of social
media around the world, and increasingly potent hardware and software that
enables us to work with these new big data streams. At the same time, many
challenging problems have been identified. First, there is often a mismatch
between how rapidly online data can change, and how rapidly algorithms are
updated, which means that there is limited reusability for algorithms trained
on past data as their performance decreases over time. Second, much of the work
is focusing on specific issues during a specific past period in time, even
though public health institutions would need flexible tools to assess multiple
evolving situations in real time. Third, most tools providing such capabilities
are proprietary systems with little algorithmic or data transparency, and thus
little buy-in from the global public health and research community. Here, we
introduce Crowdbreaks, an open platform which allows tracking of health trends
by making use of continuous crowdsourced labelling of public social media
content. The system is built in a way which automatizes the typical workflow
from data collection, filtering, labelling and training of machine learning
classifiers and therefore can greatly accelerate the research process in the

efficiently estimate the posterior distribution with limited simulations and
different types of data, (ii) how to tune and compare the performance of ABC
and related methods in estimating the posterior itself, rather than just
certain properties of the density, and (iii) how to efficiently choose among a
large set of summary statistics based on a CDE surrogate loss. We provide
theoretical and empirical evidence that justify ABC-CDE procedures that {\em

distribution-dependent regret that is asymptotically optimal, that is, matching
the $\kappa\ln T$ lower bound by Lai and Robbins (1985) and Burnetas and
Katehakis (1996), where $\kappa$ is the optimal problem-dependent constant.
This constant $\kappa$ depends on the model $\mathcal{D}$ considered (the
family of possible distributions over the arms). M\'enard and Garivier (2017)
provided strategies achieving such a bi-optimality in the parametric case of
models given by one-dimensional exponential families, while Lattimore (2016,

than $1$. We extend this result to the non-parametric case of all distributions
over $[0,1]$. We do so by combining the MOSS strategy by Audibert and Bubeck

$\sqrt{KT}$, and the KL-UCB strategy by Capp\'e et al. (2013), for which we

many fields of science and engineering. A plethora of ML applications transform
human lives at unprecedented pace and scale. This book portrays ML as the
combination of three basic components: data, model and loss. ML methods combine
these three components within computationally efficient implementations of the
basic scientific principle ""trial and error"". This principle consists of the
continuous adaptation of a hypothesis about a phenomenon that generates data.
ML methods use a hypothesis to compute predictions for future events. We
believe that thinking about ML as combinations of three components given by
data, model, and loss helps to navigate the steadily growing offer for
ready-to-use ML methods. Our three-component picture of ML allows a unified
treatment of a wide range of concepts and techniques which seem quite unrelated
at first sight. The regularization effect of early stopping in iterative
methods is due to the shrinking of the effective hypothesis space.
Privacy-preserving ML is obtained by particular choices for the features of
data points. Explainable ML methods are characterized by particular choices for
the hypothesis space. To make good use of ML tools it is instrumental to
understand its underlying principles at different levels of detail. On a lower

feature representations that extract the useful information to correctly
classify each epoch into the correct sleep stage. While many useful features

feature reduction step is necessary in order to avoid the curse of
dimensionality. One reason for the need of such a large feature set is that
many features are good for discriminating only one of the sleep stages and are
less informative during other stages. This paper explores how a second feature
representation over a large set of pre-defined features can be learned using an
auto-encoder with a selective attention for the current sleep stage in the
training batch. This selective attention allows the model to learn feature
representations that focuses on the more relevant inputs without having to

http://arxiv.org/abs/1805.08704v1,Replicating Active Appearance Model by Generator Network,"A recent Cell paper [Chang and Tsao, 2017] reports an interesting discovery.
For the face stimuli generated by a pre-trained active appearance model (AAM),
the responses of neurons in the areas of the primate brain that are responsible
for face recognition exhibit strong linear relationship with the shape
variables and appearance variables of the AAM that generates the face stimuli.
In this paper, we show that this behavior can be replicated by a deep
generative model called the generator network, which assumes that the observed
signals are generated by latent random variables via a top-down convolutional
neural network. Specifically, we learn the generator network from the face
images generated by a pre-trained AAM model using variational auto-encoder, and
we show that the inferred latent variables of the learned generator network
have strong linear relationship with the shape and appearance variables of the
AAM model that generates the face images. Unlike the AAM model that has an
explicit shape model where the shape variables generate the control points or
landmarks, the generator network has no such shape model and shape variables.
Yet the generator network can learn the shape knowledge in the sense that some
of the latent variables of the learned generator network capture the shape
variations in the face images generated by AAM.","['Tian Han', 'Jiawen Wu', 'Ying Nian Wu']","['cs.CV', 'cs.LG', 'stat.ML']",2018-05-14 04:54:00+00:00

attacks through adversarial samples. Adversarial samples are often crafted
through adversarial perturbation, i.e., manipulating the original sample with
minor modifications so that the DNN model labels the sample incorrectly. Given
that it is almost impossible to train perfect DNN, adversarial samples are
shown to be easy to generate. As DNN are increasingly used in safety-critical
systems like autonomous cars, it is crucial to develop techniques for defending
such attacks. Existing defense mechanisms which aim to make adversarial
perturbation challenging have been shown to be ineffective. In this work, we
propose an alternative approach. We first observe that adversarial samples are
much more sensitive to perturbations than normal samples. That is, if we impose
random perturbations on a normal and an adversarial sample respectively, there
is a significant difference between the ratio of label change due to the
perturbations. Observing this, we design a statistical adversary detection
algorithm called nMutant (inspired by mutation testing from software
engineering community). Our experiments show that nMutant effectively detects
most of the adversarial samples generated by recently proposed attacking
methods. Furthermore, we provide an error bound with certain statistical
significance along with the detection.","['Jingyi Wang', 'Jun Sun', 'Peixin Zhang', 'Xinyu Wang']","['cs.LG', 'stat.ML']",2018-05-14 04:48:24+00:00

Besides memory demands, learning dynamics like vanishing gradients and slow

of weights, the performance of those networks becomes limited by our ability to
accurately train them. A common naive question arises: if we have a system with
billions of degrees of freedom, don't we also need billions of samples to train
it? Of course, the success of deep learning indicates that reliable models can
be learned with reasonable amounts of data. Similar questions arise in protein
folding, spin glasses and biological neural networks. With effectively infinite
potential folding/spin/wiring configurations, how does the system find the
precise arrangement that leads to useful and robust results? Simple sampling of
the possible configurations until an optimal one is reached is not a viable
option even if one waited for the age of the universe. On the contrary, there
appears to be a mechanism in the above phenomena that forces them to achieve
configurations that live on a low-dimensional manifold, avoiding the curse of
dimensionality. In the current work we use the concept of mutual information
between successive layers of a deep neural network to elucidate this mechanism
and suggest possible ways of exploiting it to accelerate training. We show that
adding structure to the neural network that enforces higher mutual information
between layers speeds training and leads to more accurate results. High mutual

inference attacks, in which an attacker leverages a machine learning classifier
to infer a target user's private attributes (e.g., location, sexual
orientation, political view) from its public data (e.g., rating scores, page
likes). Existing defenses leverage game theory or heuristics based on
correlations between the public data and attributes. These defenses are not
practical. Specifically, game-theoretic defenses require solving intractable
optimization problems, while correlation-based defenses incur large utility
loss of users' public data.
  In this paper, we present AttriGuard, a practical defense against attribute
inference attacks. AttriGuard is computationally tractable and has small
utility loss. Our AttriGuard works in two phases. Suppose we aim to protect a
user's private attribute. In Phase I, for each value of the attribute, we find
a minimum noise such that if we add the noise to the user's public data, then
the attacker's classifier is very likely to infer the attribute value for the
user. We find the minimum noise via adapting existing evasion attacks in
adversarial machine learning. In Phase II, we sample one attribute value
according to a certain probability distribution and add the corresponding noise
found in Phase I to the user's public data. We formulate finding the
probability distribution as solving a constrained convex optimization problem.
We extensively evaluate AttriGuard and compare it with existing methods using a
real-world dataset. Our results show that AttriGuard substantially outperforms
existing methods. Our work is the first one that shows evasion attacks can be

behavior and make dynamic decisions on assortments based on the current
knowledge. The goal of the seller is to maximize the expected revenue, or
equivalently, to minimize the expected regret. Although dynamic assortment
planning problem has received an increasing attention in revenue management,
most existing policies require the estimation of mean utility for each product
and the final regret usually involves the number of products $N$. The optimal
regret of the dynamic assortment planning problem under the most basic and
popular choice model---MNL model is still open. By carefully analyzing a
revenue potential function, we develop a trisection based policy combined with
adaptive confidence bound construction, which achieves an {item-independent}
regret bound of $O(\sqrt{T})$, where $T$ is the length of selling horizon. We
further establish the matching lower bound result to show the optimality of our
policy. There are two major advantages of the proposed policy. First, the
regret of all our policies has no dependence on $N$. Second, our policies are

regression (ALR). We first propose three essential criteria that an ALR
approach should consider in selecting the most useful unlabeled samples:
informativeness, representativeness, and diversity, and compare four existing
ALR approaches against them. We then propose a new ALR approach using passive
sampling, which considers both the representativeness and the diversity in both
the initialization and subsequent iterations. Remarkably, this approach can
also be integrated with other existing ALR approaches in the literature to
further improve the performance. Extensive experiments on 11 UCI, CMU StatLib,

policy of an agent to the target task from the source task. Given their
successes on robotic action planning, current methods mostly rely on two
requirements: exactly-relevant expert demonstrations or the explicitly-coded
cost function on target task, both of which, however, are inconvenient to
obtain in practice. In this paper, we relax these two strong conditions by
developing a novel task transfer framework where the expert preference is
applied as a guidance. In particular, we alternate the following two steps:
Firstly, letting experts apply pre-defined preference rules to select related
expert demonstrates for the target task. Secondly, based on the selection
result, we learn the target cost function and trajectory distribution
simultaneously via enhanced Adversarial MaxEnt IRL and generate more
trajectories by the learned target distribution for the next preference

captures information about the structure and spatial organization of
macromolecular complexes within single cells, in near-native state and at

relative structural similarity. Therefore, it is preferable to assess the
statistical credibility of the decision through hypothesis testing, requiring
many templates derived from a diverse population of macromolecular structures.
Due to the very limited number of known structures, we need a generative model
to efficiently and reliably sample pseudo-structures from the complex
distribution of macromolecular structures. To address this challenge, we
propose a novel image-derived approach for performing hypothesis testing for
template matching by constructing generative models using the generative

template matching on both simulated and experimental subtomograms, allowing us
to conclude the identity of subtomograms with high statistical credibility and

intraoperative statistical features through a machine learning stacking

defined to characterize extreme events (i.e., when vehicles' queue lengths
exceed a predefined threshold with non-negligible probability) using extreme
value theory (EVT). Leveraging principles from federated learning (FL), the
distribution of these extreme events corresponding to the tail distribution of
queues is estimated by VUEs in a decentralized manner. Finally, Lyapunov
optimization is used to find the joint transmit power and resource allocation
policies for each VUE in a distributed manner. The proposed solution is
validated via extensive simulations using a Manhattan mobility model. It is
shown that FL enables the proposed distributed method to estimate the tail
distribution of queues with an accuracy that is very close to a centralized

required to achieve good performance. Furthermore, when nonlinear function
approximation is used, non-stationarity in the state representation can lead to
learning instability. A variety of techniques exist to combat this --- most
notably large experience replay buffers or the use of multiple parallel actors.
These techniques come at the cost of moving away from the online RL problem as
it is traditionally formulated (i.e., a single agent learning online without
maintaining a large database of training examples). Meta-learning can
potentially help with both these issues by tuning hyperparameters online and
allowing the algorithm to more robustly adjust to non-stationarity in a
problem. This paper applies meta-gradient descent to derive a set of step-size
tuning algorithms specifically for online RL control with eligibility traces.
Our novel technique, Metatrace, makes use of an eligibility trace analogous to
methods like $TD(\lambda)$. We explore tuning both a single scalar step-size
and a separate step-size for each learned parameter. We evaluate Metatrace
first for control with linear function approximation in the classic mountain
car problem and then in a noisy, non-stationary version. Finally, we apply
Metatrace for control with nonlinear function approximation in 5 games in the

http://arxiv.org/abs/1805.03963v4,Monotone Learning with Rectified Wire Networks,"We introduce a new neural network model, together with a tractable and
monotone online learning algorithm. Our model describes feed-forward networks
for classification, with one output node for each class. The only nonlinear
operation is rectification using a ReLU function with a bias. However, there is
a rectifier on every edge rather than at the nodes of the network. There are
also weights, but these are positive, static, and associated with the nodes.
Our ""rectified wire"" networks are able to represent arbitrary Boolean
functions. Only the bias parameters, on the edges of the network, are learned.
Another departure in our approach, from standard neural networks, is that the
loss function is replaced by a constraint. This constraint is simply that the
value of the output node associated with the correct class should be zero. Our
model has the property that the exact norm-minimizing parameter update,
required to correctly classify a training item, is the solution to a quadratic
program that can be computed with a few passes through the network. We
demonstrate a training algorithm using this update, called sequential
deactivation (SDA), on MNIST and some synthetic datasets. Upon adopting a
natural choice for the nodal weights, SDA has no hyperparameters other than
those describing the network structure. Our experiments explore behavior with
