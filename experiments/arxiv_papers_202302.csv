http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.11454v1,How (Implicit) Regularization of ReLU Neural Networks Characterizes the Learned Function -- Part II: the Multi-D Case of Two Layers with Random First Layer,"Randomized neural networks (randomized NNs), where only the terminal layer's
weights are optimized constitute a powerful model class to reduce computational
time in training the neural network model. At the same time, these models
generalize surprisingly well in various regression and classification tasks. In
this paper, we give an exact macroscopic characterization (i.e., a
characterization in function space) of the generalization behavior of
randomized, shallow NNs with ReLU activation (RSNs). We show that RSNs
correspond to a generalized additive model (GAM)-typed regression in which
infinitely many directions are considered: the infinite generalized additive
model (IGAM). The IGAM is formalized as solution to an optimization problem in
function space for a specific regularization functional and a fairly general
loss. This work is an extension to multivariate NNs of prior work, where we
showed how wide RSNs with ReLU activation behave like spline regression under
certain conditions and if the input is one-dimensional.","['Jakob Heiss', 'Josef Teichmann', 'Hanna Wutte']","['cs.LG', 'stat.ML']",2023-03-20 21:05:47+00:00
http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.11453v2,Greedy Pruning with Group Lasso Provably Generalizes for Matrix Sensing,"Pruning schemes have been widely used in practice to reduce the complexity of
trained models with a massive number of parameters. In fact, several practical
studies have shown that if a pruned model is fine-tuned with some
gradient-based updates it generalizes well to new samples. Although the above
pipeline, which we refer to as pruning + fine-tuning, has been extremely
successful in lowering the complexity of trained models, there is very little
known about the theory behind this success. In this paper, we address this
issue by investigating the pruning + fine-tuning framework on the
overparameterized matrix sensing problem with the ground truth $U_\star \in
\mathbb{R}^{d \times r}$ and the overparameterized model $U \in \mathbb{R}^{d
\times k}$ with $k \gg r$. We study the approximate local minima of the mean
square error, augmented with a smooth version of a group Lasso regularizer,
$\sum_{i=1}^k \| U e_i \|_2$. In particular, we provably show that pruning all
the columns below a certain explicit $\ell_2$-norm threshold results in a
solution $U_{\text{prune}}$ which has the minimum number of columns $r$, yet
close to the ground truth in training loss. Moreover, in the subsequent
fine-tuning phase, gradient descent initialized at $U_{\text{prune}}$ converges
at a linear rate to its limit. While our analysis provides insights into the
role of regularization in pruning, we also show that running gradient descent
in the absence of regularization results in models which {are not suitable for
greedy pruning}, i.e., many columns could have their $\ell_2$ norm comparable
to that of the maximum. To the best of our knowledge, our results provide the
first rigorous insights on why greedy pruning + fine-tuning leads to smaller
models which also generalize well.","['Nived Rajaraman', 'Devvrit', 'Aryan Mokhtari', 'Kannan Ramchandran']","['cs.LG', 'stat.ML']",2023-03-20 21:05:44+00:00

http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.11379v1,Solving High-Dimensional Inverse Problems with Auxiliary Uncertainty via Operator Learning with Limited Data,"In complex large-scale systems such as climate, important effects are caused
by a combination of confounding processes that are not fully observable. The
identification of sources from observations of system state is vital for
attribution and prediction, which inform critical policy decisions. The
difficulty of these types of inverse problems lies in the inability to isolate
sources and the cost of simulating computational models. Surrogate models may
enable the many-query algorithms required for source identification, but data
challenges arise from high dimensionality of the state and source, limited
ensembles of costly model simulations to train a surrogate model, and few and
potentially noisy state observations for inversion due to measurement
limitations. The influence of auxiliary processes adds an additional layer of
uncertainty that further confounds source identification. We introduce a
framework based on (1) calibrating deep neural network surrogates to the flow
maps provided by an ensemble of simulations obtained by varying sources, and
(2) using these surrogates in a Bayesian framework to identify sources from
observations via optimization. Focusing on an atmospheric dispersion exemplar,
we find that the expressive and computationally efficient nature of the deep
neural network operator surrogates in appropriately reduced dimension allows
for source identification with uncertainty quantification using limited data.
Introducing a variable wind field as an auxiliary process, we find that a
Bayesian approximation error approach is essential for reliable source
inversion when uncertainty due to wind stresses the algorithm.","['Joseph Hart', 'Mamikon Gulian', 'Indu Manickam', 'Laura Swiler']","['stat.ML', 'cs.LG', 'math.OC']",2023-03-20 18:29:23+00:00

the sensing result, the unknown permutation matrix, the design matrix, the
sparse signal, and the additive noise, respectively. Our goal is to reconstruct
both the permutation matrix $\bPitrue$ and the sparse signal $\bbetatrue$. We
investigate this problem from both the statistical and computational aspects.
From the statistical aspect, we first establish the minimax lower bounds on the
sample number $n$ and the \emph{signal-to-noise ratio} ($\snr$) for the correct
recovery of permutation matrix $\bPitrue$ and the support set
$\supp(\bbetatrue)$, to be more specific, $n \gtrsim k\log p$ and $\log\snr
\gtrsim \log n + \frac{k\log p}{n}$. Then, we confirm the tightness of these
minimax lower bounds by presenting an exhaustive-search based estimator whose
performance matches the lower bounds thereof up to some multiplicative
constants. From the computational aspect, we impose a parsimonious assumption
on the number of permuted rows and propose a computationally-efficient
estimator accordingly. Moreover, we show that our proposed estimator can obtain
the ground-truth $(\bPitrue, \supp(\bbetatrue))$ under mild conditions.
Furthermore, we provide numerical experiments to corroborate our claims.","['Hang Zhang', 'Ping Li']","['cs.IT', 'math.IT', 'stat.ML']",2023-03-20 16:14:58+00:00

optimal policy using observational data. However, this data usually contains
two deficiencies: (i) some variables that confound actions are not observed,
and (ii) missing observations exist in the collected data. Unobserved
confounders lead to a confounding bias and missing observations cause bias and
inefficiency problems. To overcome these challenges and learn the optimal
policy from the observed dataset, we present a new algorithm called
Causal-Adjusted Pessimistic (CAP) policy learning, which forms the reward
function as the solution of an integral equation system, builds a confidence
set, and greedily takes action with pessimism. With mild assumptions on the

http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.11177v1,Integration of Radiomics and Tumor Biomarkers in Interpretable Machine Learning Models,"Despite the unprecedented performance of deep neural networks (DNNs) in
computer vision, their practical application in the diagnosis and prognosis of
cancer using medical imaging has been limited. One of the critical challenges
for integrating diagnostic DNNs into radiological and oncological applications
is their lack of interpretability, preventing clinicians from understanding the
model predictions. Therefore, we study and propose the integration of
expert-derived radiomics and DNN-predicted biomarkers in interpretable
classifiers which we call ConRad, for computerized tomography (CT) scans of
lung cancer. Importantly, the tumor biomarkers are predicted from a concept
bottleneck model (CBM) such that once trained, our ConRad models do not require
labor-intensive and time-consuming biomarkers. In our evaluation and practical
application, the only input to ConRad is a segmented CT scan. The proposed
model is compared to convolutional neural networks (CNNs) which act as a black
box classifier. We further investigated and evaluated all combinations of
radiomics, predicted biomarkers and CNN features in five different classifiers.
We found the ConRad models using non-linear SVM and the logistic regression
with the Lasso outperform others in five-fold cross-validation, although we
highlight that interpretability of ConRad is its primary advantage. The Lasso
is used for feature selection, which substantially reduces the number of
non-zero weights while increasing the accuracy. Overall, the proposed ConRad
model combines CBM-derived biomarkers and radiomics features in an
interpretable ML model which perform excellently for the lung nodule malignancy
classification.","['Lennart Brocki', 'Neo Christopher Chung']","['cs.LG', 'cs.CV', 'stat.AP', 'stat.ML']",2023-03-20 15:00:52+00:00

where there exists some structural relation within the responses and also
between the covariates and a set of modifying variables. To handle this
problem, we propose MADMMplasso, a novel regularized regression method. This
method is able to find covariates and their corresponding interactions, with
some joint association with multiple related responses. We allow the
interaction term between covariate and modifying variable to be included in a
(weak) asymmetrical hierarchical manner by first considering whether the
corresponding covariate main term is in the model. For parameter estimation, we
develop an ADMM algorithm that allows us to implement the overlapping groups in
a simple way. The results from the simulations and analysis of a
pharmacogenomic screen data set show that the proposed method has an advantage
in handling correlated responses and interaction effects, both with respect to
prediction and variable selection performance.","['Theophilus Quachie Asenso', 'Manuela Zucknick']","['stat.ME', 'q-bio.QM', 'stat.ML']",2023-03-20 14:43:22+00:00

model-based methods have been widely used for fault detection, data-driven
approaches have garnered increasing attention due to their ease of deployment

Occupation kernels result in feature maps that are tailored to the measured

data by exploring the latent space of unsupervised deep generative models. We
combine manipulation of individual latent variables to extreme values with
methods inspired by causal inference into an approach we call causal
disentanglement with extreme values (CDEV) and show that this method yields
insights for model interpretability. With this, we can test for what properties
of unknown data the model encodes as meaningful, using it to glean insight into
the communication system of sperm whales (Physeter macrocephalus), one of the
most intriguing and understudied animal communication systems. The network
architecture used has been shown to learn meaningful representations of speech;
here, it is used as a learning mechanism to decipher the properties of another
vocal communication system in which case we have no ground truth. The proposed
methodology suggests that sperm whales encode information using the number of
clicks in a sequence, the regularity of their timing, and audio properties such
as the spectral mean and the acoustic regularity of the sequences. Some of
these findings are consistent with existing hypotheses, while others are
proposed for the first time. We also argue that our models uncover rules that
govern the structure of units in the communication system and apply them while
generating innovative data not shown during training. This paper suggests that
an interpretation of the outputs of deep neural networks with causal inference
methodology can be a viable strategy for approaching data about which little is
known and presents another case of how deep learning can limit the hypothesis
space. Finally, the proposed approach can be extended to other architectures
and datasets.","['Gašper Beguš', 'Andrej Leban', 'Shane Gero']","['stat.ML', 'cs.LG', 'cs.SD', 'eess.AS']",2023-03-20 08:09:13+00:00

first without any reward information, in order to achieve certain learning
goals afterwards for any given reward. In this paper we focus on reward-free RL
under low-rank MDP models, in which both the representation and linear weight
vectors are unknown. Although various algorithms have been proposed for
reward-free low-rank MDPs, the corresponding sample complexity is still far
from being satisfactory. In this work, we first provide the first known sample
complexity lower bound that holds for any algorithm under low-rank MDPs. This
lower bound implies it is strictly harder to find a near-optimal policy under
low-rank MDPs than under linear MDPs. We then propose a novel model-based
algorithm, coined RAFFLE, and show it can both find an $\epsilon$-optimal
policy and achieve an $\epsilon$-accurate system identification via reward-free
exploration, with a sample complexity significantly improving the previous
results. Such a sample complexity matches our lower bound in the dependence on
$\epsilon$, as well as on $K$ in the large $d$ regime, where $d$ and $K$
respectively denote the representation dimension and action space cardinality.
Finally, we provide a planning algorithm (without further interaction with true
environment) for RAFFLE to learn a near-accurate representation, which is the

We first provide tight excess risk lower bounds for Gradient Descent (GD) and
Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) under the general non-realizable smooth SCO
setting, suggesting that existing stability analyses are tight in step-size and
iteration dependence, and that overfitting provably happens. Next, we study the
case when the loss is realizable, i.e. an optimal solution minimizes all the
data points. Recent works show better rates can be attained but the improvement
is reduced when training time is long. Our paper examines this observation by
providing excess risk lower bounds for GD and SGD in two realizable settings:
1) $\eta T = \bigO{n}$, and (2) $\eta T = \bigOmega{n}$, where $n$ is the size
of dataset. In the first case $\eta T = \bigOmega{n}$, our lower bounds tightly
match and certify the respective upper bounds. However, for the case $\eta T =

for machine learning. However, most of the preceding analyses are conducted
under amenable conditions such as unbiased gradient estimator and bounded
objective functions, which does not encompass many sophisticated applications,

variational inference. In this paper, we consider the SGD algorithm that employ
the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) estimator to compute the gradient, called
MCMC-SGD. Since MCMC reduces the sampling complexity significantly, it is an
asymptotically convergent biased estimator in practice. Moreover, by
incorporating a general class of unbounded functions, it is much more difficult
to analyze the MCMC sampling error. Therefore, we assume that the function is
sub-exponential and use the Bernstein inequality for non-stationary Markov
chains to derive error bounds of the MCMC estimator. Consequently, MCMC-SGD is
proven to have a first order convergence rate $O(\log K/\sqrt{n K})$ with $K$
iterations and a sample size $n$. It partially explains how MCMC influences the
behavior of SGD. Furthermore, we verify the correlated negative curvature

exploration phase. The sample complexities of existing reward-free algorithms
have a polynomial dependence on the planning horizon, which makes them
intractable for long planning horizon RL problems. In this paper, we propose a
new reward-free algorithm for learning linear mixture Markov decision processes
(MDPs), where the transition probability can be parameterized as a linear
combination of known feature mappings. At the core of our algorithm is
uncertainty-weighted value-targeted regression with exploration-driven
pseudo-reward and a high-order moment estimator for the aleatoric and epistemic
uncertainties. When the total reward is bounded by $1$, we show that our
algorithm only needs to explore $\tilde O( d^2\varepsilon^{-2})$ episodes to
find an $\varepsilon$-optimal policy, where $d$ is the dimension of the feature
mapping. The sample complexity of our algorithm only has a polylogarithmic
dependence on the planning horizon and therefore is ""horizon-free"". In
addition, we provide an $\Omega(d^2\varepsilon^{-2})$ sample complexity lower
bound, which matches the sample complexity of our algorithm up to logarithmic
factors, suggesting that our algorithm is optimal.","['Junkai Zhang', 'Weitong Zhang', 'Quanquan Gu']","['cs.LG', 'math.OC', 'stat.ML']",2023-03-17 17:53:28+00:00

to find the right balance between under- and overfitting in the context of

on the DeepMind Control Suite and the Atari $100$k benchmark. The results
demonstrate that one can better balance under- and overestimation by adjusting
the UTD ratio with our approach compared to the default setting in DreamerV2
and that it is competitive with an extensive hyperparameter search which is not
feasible for many applications. Our method eliminates the need to set the UTD
hyperparameter by hand and even leads to a higher robustness with regard to

error of chart autoencoders, and we demonstrate their denoising capabilities by
considering $n$ noisy training samples, along with their noise-free

for efficient parameter estimation and model assessment when model evaluations
are mildly-to-very expensive (e.g., a second or more) and/or noisy.
Specifically, VBMC computes:
  - a flexible (non-Gaussian) approximate posterior distribution of the model
parameters, from which statistics and posterior samples can be easily
extracted;
  - an approximation of the model evidence or marginal likelihood, a metric
used for Bayesian model selection.
  PyVBMC can be applied to any computational or statistical model with up to
roughly 10-15 continuous parameters, with the only requirement that the user
can provide a Python function that computes the target log likelihood of the
model, or an approximation thereof (e.g., an estimate of the likelihood
obtained via simulation or Monte Carlo methods). PyVBMC is particularly
effective when the model takes more than about a second per evaluation, with
dramatic speed-ups of 1-2 orders of magnitude when compared to traditional
approximate inference methods.
  Extensive benchmarks on both artificial test problems and a large number of
real models from the computational sciences, particularly computational and
cognitive neuroscience, show that VBMC generally - and often vastly -

http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.07597v1,Fast Regularized Discrete Optimal Transport with Group-Sparse Regularizers,"Regularized discrete optimal transport (OT) is a powerful tool to measure the
distance between two discrete distributions that have been constructed from
data samples on two different domains. While it has a wide range of
applications in machine learning, in some cases the sampled data from only one
of the domains will have class labels such as unsupervised domain adaptation.
In this kind of problem setting, a group-sparse regularizer is frequently
leveraged as a regularization term to handle class labels. In particular, it
can preserve the label structure on the data samples by corresponding the data
samples with the same class label to one group-sparse regularization term. As a
result, we can measure the distance while utilizing label information by
solving the regularized optimization problem with gradient-based algorithms.
However, the gradient computation is expensive when the number of classes or
data samples is large because the number of regularization terms and their
respective sizes also turn out to be large. This paper proposes fast discrete
OT with group-sparse regularizers. Our method is based on two ideas. The first
is to safely skip the computations of the gradients that must be zero. The
second is to efficiently extract the gradients that are expected to be nonzero.
Our method is guaranteed to return the same value of the objective function as
that of the original method. Experiments show that our method is up to 8.6
times faster than the original method without degrading accuracy.","['Yasutoshi Ida', 'Sekitoshi Kanai', 'Kazuki Adachi', 'Atsutoshi Kumagai', 'Yasuhiro Fujiwara']","['cs.LG', 'stat.ML']",2023-03-14 02:40:46+00:00

lengthy: survey measures comprising hundreds of items are the norm rather than
the exception. However, literature suggests that the longer a questionnaire
takes, the higher the probability that participants lose interest and start
responding carelessly. Consequently, in long surveys a large number of
participants may engage in careless responding, posing a major threat to
internal validity. We propose a novel method for identifying the onset of
careless responding (or an absence thereof) for each participant. It is based
on combined measurements of multiple dimensions in which carelessness may
manifest, such as inconsistency and invariability. Since a structural break in
either dimension is potentially indicative of carelessness, the proposed method
searches for evidence for changepoints along the combined measurements. It is
highly flexible, based on machine learning, and provides statistical guarantees
on its performance. An empirical application on data from a seminal study on
the incidence of careless responding reveals that the reported incidence has
likely been substantially underestimated due to the presence of respondents
that were careless for only parts of the questionnaire. In simulation
experiments, we find that the proposed method achieves high reliability in
correctly identifying carelessness onset, discriminates well between careless
and attentive respondents, and captures a variety of careless response types,
even when a large number of careless respondents are present. Furthermore, we

applications. This paper focuses on two model compression techniques: low-rank
approximation and weight pruning in neural networks, which are very popular
nowadays. However, training NN with low-rank approximation and weight pruning
always suffers significant accuracy loss and convergence issues. In this paper,
a holistic framework is proposed for model compression from a novel perspective
of nonconvex optimization by designing an appropriate objective function. Then,
we introduce NN-BCD, a block coordinate descent (BCD) algorithm to solve the
nonconvex optimization. One advantage of our algorithm is that an efficient
iteration scheme can be derived with closed-form, which is gradient-free.
Therefore, our algorithm will not suffer from vanishing/exploding gradient
problems. Furthermore, with the Kurdyka-{\L}ojasiewicz (K{\L}) property of our
objective function, we show that our algorithm globally converges to a critical
point at the rate of O(1/k), where k denotes the number of iterations. Lastly,

large datasets combine they can produce remarkable results. In deep
reinforcement learning (RL), this paradigm is commonly made possible through
experience replay, whereby a dataset of past experiences is used to train a
policy or value function. However, unlike in supervised or self-supervised
learning, an RL agent has to collect its own data, which is often limited.
Thus, it is challenging to reap the benefits of deep learning, and even small
neural networks can overfit at the start of training. In this work, we leverage
the tremendous recent progress in generative modeling and propose Synthetic
Experience Replay (SynthER), a diffusion-based approach to flexibly upsample an
agent's collected experience. We show that SynthER is an effective method for
training RL agents across offline and online settings, in both proprioceptive
and pixel-based environments. In offline settings, we observe drastic
improvements when upsampling small offline datasets and see that additional
synthetic data also allows us to effectively train larger networks.
Furthermore, SynthER enables online agents to train with a much higher
update-to-data ratio than before, leading to a significant increase in sample
efficiency, without any algorithmic changes. We believe that synthetic training

http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.06562v2,ContraNorm: A Contrastive Learning Perspective on Oversmoothing and Beyond,"Oversmoothing is a common phenomenon in a wide range of Graph Neural Networks
(GNNs) and Transformers, where performance worsens as the number of layers
increases. Instead of characterizing oversmoothing from the view of complete
collapse in which representations converge to a single point, we dive into a
more general perspective of dimensional collapse in which representations lie
in a narrow cone. Accordingly, inspired by the effectiveness of contrastive
learning in preventing dimensional collapse, we propose a novel normalization
layer called ContraNorm. Intuitively, ContraNorm implicitly shatters
representations in the embedding space, leading to a more uniform distribution
and a slighter dimensional collapse. On the theoretical analysis, we prove that
ContraNorm can alleviate both complete collapse and dimensional collapse under
certain conditions. Our proposed normalization layer can be easily integrated
into GNNs and Transformers with negligible parameter overhead. Experiments on
various real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed
ContraNorm. Our implementation is available at

http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.06561v2,Phase Diagram of Initial Condensation for Two-layer Neural Networks,"The phenomenon of distinct behaviors exhibited by neural networks under
varying scales of initialization remains an enigma in deep learning research.
In this paper, based on the earlier work by Luo et al.~\cite{luo2021phase}, we
present a phase diagram of initial condensation for two-layer neural networks.
Condensation is a phenomenon wherein the weight vectors of neural networks
concentrate on isolated orientations during the training process, and it is a
feature in non-linear learning process that enables neural networks to possess
better generalization abilities. Our phase diagram serves to provide a
comprehensive understanding of the dynamical regimes of neural networks and
their dependence on the choice of hyperparameters related to initialization.
Furthermore, we demonstrate in detail the underlying mechanisms by which small
initialization leads to condensation at the initial training stage.","['Zhengan Chen', 'Yuqing Li', 'Tao Luo', 'Zhangchen Zhou', 'Zhi-Qin John Xu']","['cs.LG', 'cond-mat.dis-nn', 'math.OC', 'stat.ML', '68U99, 90C26, 34A45']",2023-03-12 03:55:38+00:00
http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.06526v1,Data Dependent Regret Guarantees Against General Comparators for Full or Bandit Feedback,"We study the adversarial online learning problem and create a completely
online algorithmic framework that has data dependent regret guarantees in both
full expert feedback and bandit feedback settings. We study the expected
performance of our algorithm against general comparators, which makes it
applicable for a wide variety of problem scenarios. Our algorithm works from a
universal prediction perspective and the performance measure used is the
expected regret against arbitrary comparator sequences, which is the difference
between our losses and a competing loss sequence. The competition class can be
designed to include fixed arm selections, switching bandits, contextual
bandits, periodic bandits or any other competition of interest. The sequences
in the competition class are generally determined by the specific application
at hand and should be designed accordingly. Our algorithm neither uses nor
needs any preliminary information about the loss sequences and is completely
online. Its performance bounds are data dependent, where any affine transform
of the losses has no effect on the normalized regret.","['Kaan Gokcesu', 'Hakan Gokcesu']","['cs.LG', 'cs.IT', 'eess.SP', 'math.IT', 'math.OC', 'stat.ML']",2023-03-12 00:18:46+00:00
http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.06484v2,Generalizing and Decoupling Neural Collapse via Hyperspherical Uniformity Gap,"The neural collapse (NC) phenomenon describes an underlying geometric
symmetry for deep neural networks, where both deeply learned features and
classifiers converge to a simplex equiangular tight frame. It has been shown
that both cross-entropy loss and mean square error can provably lead to NC. We
remove NC's key assumption on the feature dimension and the number of classes,
and then present a generalized neural collapse (GNC) hypothesis that
effectively subsumes the original NC. Inspired by how NC characterizes the
training target of neural networks, we decouple GNC into two objectives:
minimal intra-class variability and maximal inter-class separability. We then
use hyperspherical uniformity (which characterizes the degree of uniformity on
the unit hypersphere) as a unified framework to quantify these two objectives.
Finally, we propose a general objective -- hyperspherical uniformity gap (HUG),
which is defined by the difference between inter-class and intra-class
hyperspherical uniformity. HUG not only provably converges to GNC, but also
decouples GNC into two separate objectives. Unlike cross-entropy loss that
couples intra-class compactness and inter-class separability, HUG enjoys more
flexibility and serves as a good alternative loss function. Empirical results
show that HUG works well in terms of generalization and robustness.","['Weiyang Liu', 'Longhui Yu', 'Adrian Weller', 'Bernhard Schölkopf']","['cs.LG', 'cs.CV', 'stat.ML']",2023-03-11 19:33:24+00:00
