structures. However, many modern applications such as gene network discovery
and social interactions analysis often involve high-dimensional noisy data with
outliers or heavier tails than the Gaussian distribution. In this paper, we
propose the Trimmed Graphical Lasso for robust estimation of sparse GGMs. Our
method guards against outliers by an implicit trimming mechanism akin to the
popular Least Trimmed Squares method used for linear regression. We provide a
rigorous statistical analysis of our estimator in the high-dimensional setting.
In contrast, existing approaches for robust sparse GGMs estimation lack
statistical guarantees. Our theoretical results are complemented by experiments
on simulated and real gene expression data which further demonstrate the value
of our approach.","['Eunho Yang', 'Aurélie C. Lozano']",['stat.ML'],2015-10-28 22:27:25+00:00

exchangeability is a natural assumption when the ordering of vertices does not
matter. There is a deep structural theory for exchangeable undirected graphs,
which extends to the directed case via measurable objects known as digraphons.
Using digraphons, we first show how to construct models for exchangeable
directed graphs, including special cases such as tournaments, linear orderings,
directed acyclic graphs, and partial orderings. We then show how to construct
priors on digraphons via the infinite relational digraphon model (di-IRM), a
new Bayesian nonparametric block model for exchangeable directed graphs, and
demonstrate inference on synthetic data.","['Diana Cai', 'Nathanael Ackerman', 'Cameron Freer']","['math.ST', 'stat.ME', 'stat.ML', 'stat.TH', '60G09, 05C20 (Primary), 62F15, 62G05 (Secondary)']",2015-10-28 19:59:13+00:00

machine learning tasks since they can effectively extract nonlinear relations.
However, their time complexity can be rather large especially for clustering
tasks. In this paper we define a general class of kernels that can be easily
approximated by randomization. These kernels appear in various applications, in
particular, traditional spectral clustering, landmark-based spectral clustering
and landmark-based subspace clustering. We show that for $n$ data points from
$K$ clusters with $D$ landmarks, the randomization procedure results in an
algorithm of complexity $O(KnD)$. Furthermore, we bound the error between the
original clustering scheme and its randomization. To illustrate the power of
this framework, we propose a new fast landmark subspace (FLS) clustering
algorithm. Experiments over synthetic and real datasets demonstrate the
superior performance of FLS in accelerating subspace clustering with marginal
sacrifice of accuracy.","['Xu Wang', 'Gilad Lerman']",['stat.ML'],2015-10-28 18:30:40+00:00
http://arxiv.org/abs/1510.08389v1,Universal Dependency Analysis,"Most data is multi-dimensional. Discovering whether any subset of dimensions,
or subspaces, of such data is significantly correlated is a core task in data
mining. To do so, we require a measure that quantifies how correlated a
subspace is. For practical use, such a measure should be universal in the sense
that it captures correlation in subspaces of any dimensionality and allows to
meaningfully compare correlation scores across different subspaces, regardless
how many dimensions they have and what specific statistical properties their
dimensions possess. Further, it would be nice if the measure can
non-parametrically and efficiently capture both linear and non-linear
correlations.
  In this paper, we propose UDS, a multivariate correlation measure that
fulfills all of these desiderata. In short, we define \uds based on cumulative
entropy and propose a principled normalization scheme to bring its scores
across different subspaces to the same domain, enabling universal correlation
assessment. UDS is purely non-parametric as we make no assumption on data
distributions nor types of correlation. To compute it on empirical data, we
introduce an efficient and non-parametric method. Extensive experiments show
that UDS outperforms state of the art.","['Hoang-Vu Nguyen', 'Jilles Vreeken']","['stat.ML', 'cs.LG']",2015-10-28 17:40:18+00:00

domains, including health care and network monitoring. A common approach to
detect changes is to compare the divergence between the distributions of a
reference window and a test window. When the number of dimensions is very
large, however, the naive approach has both quality and efficiency issues: to
ensure robustness the window size needs to be large, which not only leads to
missed alarms but also increases runtime.
  To this end, we propose LIGHT, a linear-time algorithm for robustly detecting
non-linear changes in massively high dimensional time series. Importantly,
LIGHT provides high flexibility in choosing the window size, allowing the
domain expert to fit the level of details required. To do such, we 1) perform
scalable PCA to reduce dimensionality, 2) perform scalable factorization of the
joint distribution, and 3) scalably compute divergences between these lower
dimensional distributions. Extensive empirical evaluation on both synthetic and

high quality one-dimensional subgroups and refinements of these is a crucial
task. For nominal attributes, this is relatively straightforward, as we can
consider individual attribute values as binary features. For numerical
attributes, the task is more challenging as individual numeric values are not
reliable statistics. Instead, we can consider combinations of adjacent values,
i.e. bins. Existing binning strategies, however, are not tailored for subgroup
discovery. That is, they do not directly optimize for the quality of subgroups,
therewith potentially degrading the mining result.
  To address this issue, we propose FLEXI. In short, with FLEXI we propose to
use optimal binning to find high quality binary features for both numeric and
ordinal attributes. We instantiate FLEXI with various quality measures and show
how to achieve efficiency accordingly. Experiments on both synthetic and
real-world data sets show that FLEXI outperforms state of the art with up to 25

shape-based interpolation or segmentation. Commonly, using Principal Components
Analysis a low-dimensional (affine) subspace of the high-dimensional shape
space is determined. However, the resulting factors (the most dominant
eigenvectors of the covariance matrix) have global support, i.e. changing the
coefficient of a single factor deforms the entire shape. In this paper, a
method to obtain deformation factors with local support is presented. The
benefits of such models include better flexibility and interpretability as well
as the possibility of interactively deforming shapes locally. For that, based
on a well-grounded theoretical motivation, we formulate a matrix factorisation
problem employing sparsity and graph-based regularisation terms. We demonstrate
that for brain shapes our method outperforms the state of the art in local

learning, image recognition, signal processing, and medical data analysis
pursue a sparse solution for the feature selection purpose and particularly
favor the nonzeros \emph{evenly} distributed in different groups. The exclusive
sparsity norm has been widely used to serve to this purpose. However, it still
lacks systematical studies for exclusive sparsity norm optimization. This paper
offers two main contributions from the optimization perspective: 1) We provide
several efficient algorithms to solve exclusive sparsity norm minimization with
either smooth loss or hinge loss (non-smooth loss). All algorithms achieve the
optimal convergence rate $O(1/k^2)$ ($k$ is the iteration number). To the best
of our knowledge, this is the first time to guarantee such convergence rate for
the general exclusive sparsity norm minimization; 2) When the group information
is unavailable to define the exclusive sparsity norm, we propose to use the
random grouping scheme to construct groups and prove that if the number of
groups is appropriately chosen, the nonzeros (true features) would be grouped
in the ideal way with high probability. Empirical studies validate the
efficiency of proposed algorithms, and the effectiveness of random grouping

http://arxiv.org/abs/1510.07786v2,A Framework to Adjust Dependency Measure Estimates for Chance,"Estimating the strength of dependency between two variables is fundamental
for exploratory analysis and many other applications in data mining. For
example: non-linear dependencies between two continuous variables can be
explored with the Maximal Information Coefficient (MIC); and categorical
variables that are dependent to the target class are selected using Gini gain
in random forests. Nonetheless, because dependency measures are estimated on
finite samples, the interpretability of their quantification and the accuracy
when ranking dependencies become challenging. Dependency estimates are not
equal to 0 when variables are independent, cannot be compared if computed on
different sample size, and they are inflated by chance on variables with more
categories. In this paper, we propose a framework to adjust dependency measure
estimates on finite samples. Our adjustments, which are simple and applicable
to any dependency measure, are helpful in improving interpretability when
quantifying dependency and in improving accuracy on the task of ranking
dependencies. In particular, we demonstrate that our approach enhances the
interpretability of MIC when used as a proxy for the amount of noise between
variables, and to gain accuracy when ranking variables during the splitting

http://arxiv.org/abs/1510.07740v2,The Wilson Machine for Image Modeling,"Learning the distribution of natural images is one of the hardest and most
important problems in machine learning. The problem remains open, because the
enormous complexity of the structures in natural images spans all length
scales. We break down the complexity of the problem and show that the hierarchy
of structures in natural images fuels a new class of learning algorithms based
on the theory of critical phenomena and stochastic processes. We approach this
problem from the perspective of the theory of critical phenomena, which was
developed in condensed matter physics to address problems with infinite
length-scale fluctuations, and build a framework to integrate the criticality
of natural images into a learning algorithm. The problem is broken down by
mapping images into a hierarchy of binary images, called bitplanes. In this
representation, the top bitplane is critical, having fluctuations in structures
over a vast range of scales. The bitplanes below go through a gradual
stochastic heating process to disorder. We turn this representation into a
directed probabilistic graphical model, transforming the learning problem into
the unsupervised learning of the distribution of the critical bitplane and the
supervised learning of the conditional distributions for the remaining
bitplanes. We learnt the conditional distributions by logistic regression in a
convolutional architecture. Conditioned on the critical binary image, this
simple architecture can generate large, natural-looking images, with many
shades of gray, without the use of hidden units, unprecedented in the studies
of natural images. The framework presented here is a major step in bringing

Geyer (1992) shows that discarding $k-1$ out of every $k$ observations will not
improve statistical efficiency, as quantified through variance in a given
computational budget. That observation is often taken to mean that thinning
MCMC output cannot improve statistical efficiency. Here we suppose that it
costs one unit of time to advance a Markov chain and then $\theta>0$ units of
time to compute a sampled quantity of interest. For a thinned process, that
cost $\theta$ is incurred less often, so it can be advanced through more
stages. Here we provide examples to show that thinning will improve statistical
efficiency if $\theta$ is large and the sample autocorrelations decay slowly
enough. If the lag $\ell\ge1$ autocorrelations of a scalar measurement satisfy
$\rho_\ell\ge\rho_{\ell+1}\ge0$, then there is always a $\theta<\infty$ at
which thinning becomes more efficient for averages of that scalar. Many sample
autocorrelation functions resemble first order AR(1) processes with $\rho_\ell
=\rho^{|\ell|}$ for some $-1<\rho<1$. For an AR(1) process it is possible to
compute the most efficient subsampling frequency $k$. The optimal $k$ grows
rapidly as $\rho$ increases towards $1$. The resulting efficiency gain depends
primarily on $\theta$, not $\rho$. Taking $k=1$ (no thinning) is optimal when
$\rho\le0$. For $\rho>0$ it is optimal if and only if $\theta \le
(1-\rho)^2/(2\rho)$. This efficiency gain never exceeds $1+\theta$. This paper
also gives efficiency bounds for autocorrelations bounded between those of two

optimization of an unknown function with assumptions usually expressed by a
Gaussian Process (GP) prior. We study an optimization strategy that directly
uses an estimate of the argmax of the function. This strategy offers both
practical and theoretical advantages: no tradeoff parameter needs to be
selected, and, moreover, we establish close connections to the popular GP-UCB

adaptively trading off exploration and exploitation in GP-UCB and GP-PI. We
illustrate the effects of this adaptive tuning via bounds on the regret as well
as an extensive empirical evaluation on robotics and vision tasks,
demonstrating the robustness of this strategy for a range of performance

from a set of dimensionality-reduced linear measurements $\mathbf{b} = \mathbf
{A}\mathbf {x}$ arises in a variety of applications, such as medical imaging,
spectroscopy, Fourier optics, and computerized tomography. Due to computational
and storage complexity or physical constraints imposed by the problem, the
measurement matrix $\mathbf{A} \in \mathbb{C}^{n \times p}$ is often of the
form $\mathbf{A} = \mathbf{P}_{\Omega}\boldsymbol{\Psi}$ for some orthonormal
basis matrix $\boldsymbol{\Psi}\in \mathbb{C}^{p \times p}$ and subsampling
operator $\mathbf{P}_{\Omega}: \mathbb{C}^{p} \rightarrow \mathbb{C}^{n}$ that

how best to choose the index set $\Omega$ in order to optimize the recovery
performance. Previous approaches to addressing this question rely on
non-uniform \emph{random} subsampling using application-specific knowledge of
the structure of $\mathbf{x}$. In this paper, we instead take a principled
learning-based approach in which a \emph{fixed} index set is chosen based on a
set of training signals $\mathbf{x}_1,\dotsc,\mathbf{x}_m$. We formulate
combinatorial optimization problems seeking to maximize the energy captured in
these signals in an average-case or worst-case sense, and we show that these
can be efficiently solved either exactly or approximately via the
identification of modularity and submodularity structures. We provide both
deterministic and statistical theoretical guarantees showing how the resulting

of parameters does not grow with the number of observations and the principal
component scores on new data can be computed with simple matrix multiplication.

Sparsity-inducing regularization methods are a popular class of methods that
simultaneously perform variable selection and model estimation. The central
problem is a quadratic optimization problem with an l0-norm penalty. Exactly
enforcing the l0-norm penalty is computationally intractable for larger scale
problems, so dif- ferent sparsity-inducing penalty functions that approximate
the l0-norm have been introduced. In this paper, we show that viewing the
problem from a convex relaxation perspective offers new insights. In
particular, we show that a popular sparsity-inducing concave penalty function
known as the Minimax Concave Penalty (MCP), and the reverse Huber penalty
derived in a recent work by Pilanci, Wainwright and Ghaoui, can both be derived
as special cases of a lifted convex relaxation called the perspective
relaxation. The optimal perspective relaxation is a related minimax problem
that balances the overall convexity and tightness of approximation to the l0
norm. We show it can be solved by a semidefinite relaxation. Moreover, a
probabilistic interpretation of the semidefinite relaxation reveals connections
with the boolean quadric polytope in combinatorial optimization. Finally by
reformulating the l0-norm pe- nalized problem as a two-level problem, with the
inner level being a Max-Cut problem, our proposed semidefinite relaxation can
be realized by replacing the inner level problem with its semidefinite
relaxation studied by Goemans and Williamson. This interpretation suggests
using the Goemans-Williamson rounding procedure to find approximate solutions
to the l0-norm penalized problem. Numerical experiments demonstrate the
tightness of our proposed semidefinite relaxation, and the effectiveness of
finding approximate solutions by Goemans-Williamson rounding.","['Hongbo Dong', 'Kun Chen', 'Jeff Linderoth']","['cs.LG', 'math.NA', 'math.OC', 'stat.ML', '90C22, 90C47, 62J07', 'G.1.3; G.1.6']",2015-10-20 22:55:48+00:00

Our main contributions are the development of novel unsupervised methods to

that quantifies the ""cost"" of evolution of one snapshot of a social network
into another snapshot under various models of polar opinion propagation. SND
has a rich semantics of a transportation problem, yet, is computable in time
linear in the number of users, which makes SND applicable to the analysis of
large-scale online social networks. In our experiments with synthetic and
real-world Twitter data, we demonstrate the utility of our distance measure for
anomalous event detection. It achieves a true positive rate of 0.83, twice as
high as that of alternatives. When employed for opinion prediction in Twitter,
our method's accuracy is 75.63%, which is 7.5% higher than that of the next
best method.

be naturally measured by the symmetric Kullback-Leibler divergence between the
pre- and post-change distributions, and that the detectability of a change of a
given magnitude worsens when the data dimension increases. This problem, which
we refer to as \emph{detectability loss}, is due to the linear relationship
between the variance of the log-likelihood and the data dimension. We

regressions are employed with the non-concave penalty function, where the
conditional mean model of the response given predictors may be misspecified.
The asymptotic properties, such as weak oracle properties, selection

adaptation and domain generalization, are concerned with such tasks, where the
only difference between those frameworks is the availability of the unlabeled

finds a representation that trades between maximizing the separability of
classes, minimizing the mismatch between domains, and maximizing the
separability of data; each of which is quantified through scatter. The
optimization problem of SCA can be reduced to a generalized eigenvalue problem,
which results in a fast and exact solution. Comprehensive experiments on

neural networks. A challenge in machine learning is to create models that
generalize to new data samples not seen in the training data. Recently, a
common flaw in several machine learning algorithms was discovered: small
perturbations added to the input data lead to consistent misclassification of
data samples. Samples that easily mislead the model are called adversarial
examples. Training a ""maxout"" network on adversarial examples has shown to
decrease this vulnerability, but also increase classification performance. This
paper shows that adversarial training has a regularizing effect also in
networks with logistic, hyperbolic tangent and rectified linear units. A simple
extension to the back-propagation method is proposed, that adds an adversarial
gradient to the training. The extension requires an additional forward and
backward pass to calculate a modified input sample, or mini batch, used as
input for standard back-propagation learning. The first experimental results on
MNIST show that the ""adversarial back-propagation"" method increases the
resistance to adversarial examples and boosts the classification performance.
The extension reduces the classification error on the permutation invariant
MNIST from 1.60% to 0.95% in a logistic network, and from 1.40% to 0.78% in a
network with rectified linear units. Results on CIFAR-10 indicate that the

procedure of experimenting big datasets and reduce the memory used when running
the algorithms. The package is not only suitable for super-computers or

http://arxiv.org/abs/1510.02855v1,AtomNet: A Deep Convolutional Neural Network for Bioactivity Prediction in Structure-based Drug Discovery,"Deep convolutional neural networks comprise a subclass of deep neural
networks (DNN) with a constrained architecture that leverages the spatial and
temporal structure of the domain they model. Convolutional networks achieve the
best predictive performance in areas such as speech and image recognition by
hierarchically composing simple local features into complex models. Although
DNNs have been used in drug discovery for QSAR and ligand-based bioactivity
predictions, none of these models have benefited from this powerful
convolutional architecture. This paper introduces AtomNet, the first
structure-based, deep convolutional neural network designed to predict the
bioactivity of small molecules for drug discovery applications. We demonstrate
how to apply the convolutional concepts of feature locality and hierarchical
composition to the modeling of bioactivity and chemical interactions. In
further contrast to existing DNN techniques, we show that AtomNet's application
of local convolutional filters to structural target information successfully
predicts new active molecules for targets with no previously known modulators.
Finally, we show that AtomNet outperforms previous docking approaches on a
diverse set of benchmarks by a large margin, achieving an AUC greater than 0.9
on 57.8% of the targets in the DUDE benchmark.","['Izhar Wallach', 'Michael Dzamba', 'Abraham Heifets']","['cs.LG', 'cs.NE', 'q-bio.BM', 'stat.ML']",2015-10-10 00:09:00+00:00

examples and the ability to interactively query labels to an oracle of a subset

class that fits the data well by making as few label queries as possible.
  This work addresses active learning with labels obtained from strong and weak
labelers, where in addition to the standard active learning setting, we have an
extra weak labeler which may occasionally provide incorrect labels. An example
is learning to classify medical images where either expensive labels may be
obtained from a physician (oracle or strong labeler), or cheaper but
occasionally incorrect labels may be obtained from a medical resident (weak
labeler). Our goal is to learn a classifier with low error on data labeled by
the oracle, while using the weak labeler to reduce the number of label queries
made to this labeler. We provide an active learning algorithm for this setting,
establish its statistical consistency, and analyze its label complexity to
characterize when it can provide label savings over using the strong labeler
alone.","['Chicheng Zhang', 'Kamalika Chaudhuri']","['cs.LG', 'stat.ML']",2015-10-09 23:15:40+00:00

that the Jaccard index is simply the result of this transformation. Finally, we
evaluate kernels based on EMI and the proposed transformation versus EMD in

number of observations, without resorting to approximations. Moreover, the
proposed model is expressive in that the family of covariance functions of the

proven to be capable of approximating arbitrarily well any

vertices, with K vertices in the planted community, edge probability p for
pairs of vertices both in the community, and edge probability q for other pairs
of vertices.
  The main focus of the paper is on weak recovery of the community based on the
graph G, with o(K) misclassified vertices on average, in the sublinear regime
$n^{1-o(1)} \leq K \leq o(n).$ A critical parameter is the effective
signal-to-noise ratio $\lambda=K^2(p-q)^2/((n-K)q)$, with $\lambda=1$
corresponding to the Kesten-Stigum threshold. We show that a belief propagation
algorithm achieves weak recovery if $\lambda>1/e$, beyond the Kesten-Stigum
threshold by a factor of $1/e.$ The belief propagation algorithm only needs to
run for $\log^\ast n+O(1) $ iterations, with the total time complexity $O(|E|
\log^*n)$, where $\log^*n$ is the iterated logarithm of $n.$ Conversely, if
$\lambda \leq 1/e$, no local algorithm can asymptotically outperform trivial
random guessing. Furthermore, a linear message-passing algorithm that
corresponds to applying power iteration to the non-backtracking matrix of the
graph is shown to attain weak recovery if and only if $\lambda>1$. In addition,
the belief propagation algorithm can be combined with a linear-time voting
procedure to achieve the information limit of exact recovery (correctly

as the number of base hypotheses becomes larger, boosting can lead to a
deterioration of test performance. Overfitting is an important and ubiquitous
phenomenon, especially in regression settings. To avoid overfitting, we
consider using $l_1$ regularization. We propose a novel Frank-Wolfe type
boosting algorithm (FWBoost) applied to general loss functions. By using
exponential loss, the FWBoost algorithm can be rewritten as a variant of
AdaBoost for binary classification. FWBoost algorithms have exactly the same
form as existing boosting methods, in terms of making calls to a base learning
algorithm with different weights update. This direct connection between
boosting and Frank-Wolfe yields a new algorithm that is as practical as
existing boosting methods but with new guarantees and rates of convergence.
Experimental results show that the test performance of FWBoost is not degraded

National University.
  In this work we introduce several new optimisation methods for problems in
machine learning. Our algorithms broadly fall into two categories: optimisation
of finite sums and of graph structured objectives. The finite sum problem is
simply the minimisation of objective functions that are naturally expressed as
a summation over a large number of terms, where each term has a similar or
identical weight. Such objectives most often appear in machine learning in the
empirical risk minimisation framework in the non-online learning setting. The
second category, that of graph structured objectives, consists of objectives
that result from applying maximum likelihood to Markov random field models.
Unlike the finite sum case, all the non-linearity is contained within a
partition function term, which does not readily decompose into a summation.
  For the finite sum problem, we introduce the Finito and SAGA algorithms, as
well as variants of each.
  For graph-structured problems, we take three complementary approaches. We
look at learning the parameters for a fixed structure, learning the structure
independently, and learning both simultaneously. Specifically, for the combined
approach, we introduce a new method for encouraging graph structures with the
""scale-free"" property. For the structure learning problem, we establish
SHORTCUT, a O(n^{2.5}) expected time approximate structure learning method for
Gaussian graphical models. For problems where the structure is known but the
parameters unknown, we introduce an approximate maximum likelihood learning
algorithm that is capable of learning a useful subclass of Gaussian graphical
models.",['Aaron Defazio'],"['cs.LG', 'stat.ML']",2015-10-09 00:34:12+00:00

ensembles and complex probabilistic graphical models, can be expensive to
store, slow to evaluate and hard to integrate into larger systems. Ideally, we
would like to replace such cumbersome models with simpler models that perform
equally well.
  In this thesis, we study knowledge distillation, the idea of extracting the
knowledge contained in a complex model and injecting it into a more convenient
model. We present a general framework for knowledge distillation, whereby a
convenient model of our choosing learns how to mimic a complex model, by
observing the latter's behaviour and being penalized whenever it fails to
reproduce it.
  We develop our framework within the context of three distinct machine
learning applications: (a) model compression, where we compress large
discriminative models, such as ensembles of neural networks, into models of
much smaller size; (b) compact predictive distributions for Bayesian inference,
where we distil large bags of MCMC samples into compact predictive
distributions in closed form; (c) intractable generative models, where we
distil unnormalizable models such as RBMs into tractable models such as NADEs.
  We contribute to the state of the art with novel techniques and ideas. In
model compression, we describe and implement derivative matching, which allows
for better distillation when data is scarce. In compact predictive
distributions, we introduce online distillation, which allows for significant
savings in memory. Finally, in intractable generative models, we show how to
use distilled models to robustly estimate intractable quantities of the
original model, such as its intractable partition function.",['George Papamakarios'],"['stat.ML', 'cs.LG']",2015-10-08 18:40:50+00:00

graphs into a Bayesian model rather than proposing mechanisms for their
analysis. In this paper we propose to use efficient algorithms to make exact
inference in Bayesian attack graphs, enabling the static and dynamic network

high-order interactions are almost always built by modelling responses of a
stack of local linear filters. Actual interaction structure is specified
implicitly by the filter coefficients. In contrast, we learn an explicit
high-order MGRF structure by considering the learning process in terms of
general exponential family distributions nested over base models, so that
potentials added later can build on previous ones. We relatively rapidly add
new features by skipping over the costly optimisation of parameters.
  We introduce the use of local binary patterns as features in MGRF texture
models, and generalise them by learning offsets to the surrounding pixels.
These prove effective as high-order features, and are fast to compute. Several
schemes for selecting high-order features by composition or search of a small
subclass are compared. Additionally we present a simple modification of the
maximum likelihood as a texture modelling-specific objective function which
aims to improve generalisation by local windowing of statistics.
  The proposed method was experimentally evaluated by learning high-order MGRF
models for a broad selection of complex textures and then performing texture
synthesis, and succeeded on much of the continuum from stochastic through
irregularly structured to near-regular textures. Learning interaction structure
is very beneficial for textures with large-scale structure, although those with
complex irregular structure still provide difficulties. The texture models were
also quantitatively evaluated on two tasks and found to be competitive with
other works: grading of synthesised textures by a panel of observers; and
comparison against several recent MGRF models by evaluation on a constrained
inpainting task.","['Ralph Versteegen', ""Georgy Gimel'farb"", 'Patricia Riddle']","['cs.CV', 'cs.LG', 'stat.ML']",2015-10-08 15:22:21+00:00
