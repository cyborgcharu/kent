http://arxiv.org/abs/1508.07384v2,Generalized Uniformly Optimal Methods for Nonlinear Programming,"In this paper, we present a generic framework to extend existing uniformly
optimal convex programming algorithms to solve more general nonlinear, possibly
nonconvex, optimization problems. The basic idea is to incorporate a local
search step (gradient descent or Quasi-Newton iteration) into these uniformly
optimal convex programming methods, and then enforce a monotone decreasing
property of the function values computed along the trajectory. Algorithms of
these types will then achieve the best known complexity for nonconvex problems,
and the optimal complexity for convex ones without requiring any problem
parameters. As a consequence, we can have a unified treatment for a general
class of nonlinear programming problems regardless of their convexity and
smoothness level. In particular, we show that the accelerated gradient and
level methods, both originally designed for solving convex optimization
problems only, can be used for solving both convex and nonconvex problems
uniformly. In a similar vein, we show that some well-studied techniques for
nonlinear programming, e.g., Quasi-Newton iteration, can be embedded into
optimal convex optimization algorithms to possibly further enhance their
numerical performance. Our theoretical and algorithmic developments are
complemented by some promising numerical results obtained for solving a few
important nonconvex and nonlinear data analysis problems in the literature.","['Saeed Ghadimi', 'Guanghui Lan', 'Hongchao Zhang']","['math.OC', 'stat.ML']",2015-08-29 01:03:47+00:00

output given the input varies as a function of additional task variables. In
varying-coefficient models with Gaussian process priors, a Gaussian process
generates the functional relationship between the task variables and the
parameters of this conditional. Varying-coefficient models subsume hierarchical
Bayesian multitask models, but also generalizations in which the conditional
varies continuously, for instance, in time or space. However, Bayesian
inference in varying-coefficient models is generally intractable. We show that
inference for varying-coefficient models with isotropic Gaussian process priors
resolves to standard inference for a Gaussian process that can be solved
efficiently. MAP inference in this model resolves to multitask learning using
task and instance kernels, and inference for hierarchical Bayesian multitask
models can be carried out efficiently using graph-Laplacian kernels. We report
on experiments for geospatial prediction.","['Matthias Bussas', 'Christoph Sawade', 'Tobias Scheffer', 'Niels Landwehr']","['cs.LG', 'stat.ML', 'I.2.6']",2015-08-28 13:13:49+00:00

applications, ranging from speech recognition, visual object recognition, to
text processing. However, most of the current deep learning methods suffer from
scalability problems for large-scale applications, forcing researchers or users
to focus on small-scale problems with fewer parameters.
  In this paper, we consider a well-known machine learning model, deep belief
networks (DBNs) that have yielded impressive classification performance on a
large number of benchmark machine learning tasks. To scale up DBN, we propose
an approach that can use the computing clusters in a distributed environment to
train large models, while the dense matrix computations within a single machine
are sped up using graphics processors (GPU). When training a DBN, each machine
randomly drops out a portion of neurons in each hidden layer, for each training
case, making the remaining neurons only learn to detect features that are
generally helpful for producing the correct answer. Within our approach, we
have developed four methods to combine outcomes from each machine to form a
unified model. Our preliminary experiment on the mnst handwritten digit

the Gaussian mixture model (GMM). While the compressive sensing is performed
globally on the entire image as implemented in our lensless camera, a low-rank
GMM is imposed on the local image patches. This low-rank GMM is derived via
eigenvalue thresholding of the GMM trained on the projection of the measurement
data, thus learned {\em in situ}. The GMM and the projection of the measurement
data are updated iteratively during the reconstruction. Our GMM algorithm
degrades to the piecewise linear estimator (PLE) if each patch is represented
by a single Gaussian model. Inspired by this, a low-rank PLE algorithm is also
developed for CS inversion, constituting an additional contribution of this
paper. Extensive results on both simulation data and real data captured by the
lensless camera demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed algorithm.
Furthermore, we compare the CS reconstruction results using our algorithm with
the JPEG compression. Simulation results demonstrate that when limited
bandwidth is available (a small number of measurements), our algorithm can
achieve comparable results as JPEG.","['Xin Yuan', 'Hong Jiang', 'Gang Huang', 'Paul A. Wilford']","['stat.ML', 'cs.LG', 'stat.AP']",2015-08-27 15:35:11+00:00

modeling, where the number of mixture components grows with the number of data
items. The Hierarchical Dirichlet Process (HDP), is an extension of DP for
grouped data, often used for non-parametric topic modeling, where each group is
a mixture over shared mixture densities. The Nested Dirichlet Process (nDP), on
the other hand, is an extension of the DP for learning group level
distributions from data, simultaneously clustering the groups. It allows group
level distributions to be shared across groups in a non-parametric setting,
leading to a non-parametric mixture of mixtures. The nCRF extends the nDP for
multilevel non-parametric mixture modeling, enabling modeling topic
hierarchies. However, the nDP and nCRF do not allow sharing of distributions as
required in many applications, motivating the need for multi-level
non-parametric admixture modeling. We address this gap by proposing multi-level
nested HDPs (nHDP) where the base distribution of the HDP is itself a HDP at
each level thereby leading to admixtures of admixtures at each level. Because
of couplings between various HDP levels, scaling up is naturally a challenge
during inference. We propose a multi-level nested Chinese Restaurant Franchise
(nCRF) representation for the nested HDP, with which we outline an inference
algorithm based on Gibbs Sampling. We evaluate our model with the two level
nHDP for non-parametric entity topic modeling where an inner HDP creates a
countably infinite set of topic mixtures and associates them with author
entities, while an outer HDP associates documents with these author entities.
In our experiments on two real world research corpora, the nHDP is able to
generalize significantly better than existing models and detect missing author
entities with a reasonable level of accuracy.","['Lavanya Sita Tekumalla', 'Priyanka Agrawal', 'Indrajit Bhattacharya']","['stat.ML', 'cs.LG']",2015-08-26 11:24:36+00:00

constrained in a pre-selected subspace. Applications to classification and
clustering are explored. An EM-type estimation algorithm is derived. We prove
that the subspace containing the component means of a GMM with a common
covariance matrix also contains the modes of the density and the class means.
This motivates us to find a subspace by applying weighted principal component
analysis to the modes of a kernel density and the class means. To circumvent
the difficulty of deciding the kernel bandwidth, we acquire multiple subspaces
from the kernel densities based on a sequence of bandwidths. The GMM
constrained by each subspace is estimated; and the model yielding the maximum
likelihood is chosen. A dimension reduction property is proved in the sense of
being informative for classification or clustering. Experiments on real and
simulated data sets are conducted to examine several ways of determining the
subspace and to compare with the reduced rank mixture discriminant analysis
(MDA). Our new method with the simple technique of spanning the subspace only
by class means often outperforms the reduced rank MDA when the subspace

seek a consensus between side information and the observed data. Our method is
based on a nonparametric Bayesian hierarchical model that combines the
probabilistic model for the data instance and the one for the side-information.
An efficient Gibbs sampling algorithm is proposed for posterior inference.
Using the small-variance asymptotics of our probabilistic model, we then derive
a new deterministic clustering algorithm (RDP-means). It can be viewed as an
extension of K-means that allows for the inclusion of side information and has
the additional property that the number of clusters does not need to be
specified a priori. Empirical studies have been carried out to compare our work
with many constrained clustering algorithms from the literature on both a
variety of data sets and under a variety of conditions such as using noisy side
information and erroneous k values. The results of our experiments show strong

http://arxiv.org/abs/1509.01199v1,Inferring Passenger Type from Commuter Eigentravel Matrices,"A sufficient knowledge of the demographics of a commuting public is essential
in formulating and implementing more targeted transportation policies, as
commuters exhibit different ways of traveling. With the advent of the Automated
Fare Collection system (AFC), probing the travel patterns of commuters has
become less invasive and more accessible. Consequently, numerous transport
studies related to human mobility have shown that these observed patterns allow
one to pair individuals with locations and/or activities at certain times of
the day. However, classifying commuters using their travel signatures is yet to
be thoroughly examined.
  Here, we contribute to the literature by demonstrating a procedure to
characterize passenger types (Adult, Child/Student, and Senior Citizen) based
on their three-month travel patterns taken from a smart fare card system. We
first establish a method to construct distinct commuter matrices, which we
refer to as eigentravel matrices, that capture the characteristic travel
routines of individuals. From the eigentravel matrices, we build classification
models that predict the type of passengers traveling. Among the models
explored, the gradient boosting method (GBM) gives the best prediction accuracy
at 76%, which is 84% better than the minimum model accuracy (41%) required
vis-\`a-vis the proportional chance criterion. In addition, we find that travel
features generated during weekdays have greater predictive power than those on
weekends. This work should not only be useful for transport planners, but for
market researchers as well. With the awareness of which commuter types are
traveling, ads, service announcements, and surveys, among others, can be made
more targeted spatiotemporally. Finally, our framework should be effective in
creating synthetic populations for use in real-world simulations that involve a
metropolitan's public transport system.","['Erika Fille Legara', 'Christopher Monterola']","['physics.soc-ph', 'cs.CY', 'physics.data-an', 'stat.AP', 'stat.ML']",2015-08-25 16:10:08+00:00

numerical instability issues. Regularization is known to be effective in such
cases, so that we introduce, in the framework of Tikhonov regularization, a
matricial reformulation of the problem which allows us to use the condition
number as a diagnostic tool for identification of instability. By imposing
well-conditioning requirements on the relevant matrices, our theoretical
analysis allows the identification of an optimal value for the regularization
parameter from the standpoint of stability. We compare with the value derived
by cross-validation for overfitting control and optimisation of the
generalization performance. We test our method for both regression and
classification tasks. The proposed method is quite effective in terms of
predictivity, often with some improvement on performance with respect to the
reference cases considered. This approach, due to analytical determination of
the regularization parameter, dramatically reduces the computational load

the Area Under the ROC Curve (AUC) as it widely used and has a strong
theoretical underpinning. In practical recommendation, only items at the top of

how to prioritise the top of the list. The objectives are differentiable and
optimised through a carefully designed stochastic gradient-descent-based
algorithm which scales linearly with the size of the data. In the special case
of square loss we show how to improve computational complexity by leveraging
previously computed measures. To understand theoretically the underlying matrix
factorisation approaches we study both the consistency of the loss functions
with respect to AUC, and generalisation using Rademacher theory. The resulting

interesting geometric motivation. DWD was originally proposed as a superior
alternative to the support vector machine (SVM), however DWD is yet to be

state-of-the-art algorithm for solving DWD is based on the second-order-cone
programming (SOCP), while the SVM is a quadratic programming problem which is
much more efficient to solve. Second, the current statistical theory of DWD
mainly focuses on the linear DWD for the high-dimension-low-sample-size setting
and data-piling, while the learning theory for the SVM mainly focuses on the
Bayes risk consistency of the kernel SVM. In fact, the Bayes risk consistency
of DWD is presented as an open problem in the original DWD paper. In this work,
we advance the current understanding of DWD from both computational and
theoretical perspectives. We propose a novel efficient algorithm for solving
DWD, and our algorithm can be several hundred times faster than the existing
state-of-the-art algorithm based on the SOCP. In addition, our algorithm can
handle the generalized DWD, while the SOCP algorithm only works well for a
special DWD but not the generalized DWD. Furthermore, we consider a natural
kernel DWD in a reproducing kernel Hilbert space and then establish the Bayes
risk consistency of the kernel DWD. We compare DWD and the SVM on several

accuracy, but DWD equipped with our new algorithm can be much faster to compute

as a Markov decision process (MDP). We study how to utilize the monotonicity of
the optimal transmission policy to relieve the computational complexity of
dynamic programming (DP). In this system, a scheduler controls the bit rate of
the m-quadrature amplitude modulation (m-QAM) in order to minimize the
long-term losses incurred by the queue overflow in the data link layer and the
transmission power consumption in the physical layer. The work is done in two
steps. Firstly, we observe the L-natural-convexity and submodularity of DP to
prove that the optimal policy is always nondecreasing in queue occupancy/state
and derive the sufficient condition for it to be nondecreasing in both queue
and channel states. We also show that, due to the L-natural-convexity of DP,
the variation of the optimal policy in queue state is restricted by a bounded
marginal effect: The increment of the optimal policy between adjacent queue
states is no greater than one. Secondly, we use the monotonicity results to
present two low complexity algorithms: monotonic policy iteration (MPI) based
on L-natural-convexity and discrete simultaneous perturbation stochastic
approximation (DSPSA). We run experiments to show that the time complexity of
MPI based on L-natural-convexity is much lower than that of DP and the
conventional MPI that is based on submodularity and DSPSA is able to adaptively
track the optimal policy when the system parameters change.","['Ni Ding', 'Parastoo Sadeghi', 'Rodney A. Kennedy']","['stat.ML', 'cs.IT', 'math.IT']",2015-08-21 03:23:21+00:00

are required to be scalable, incrementally trainable, must remain bounded in
size (even when the data stream is arbitrarily long), and be nonparametric in
order to achieve high accuracy even in complex and dynamic environments.
Moreover, the learning system must be parameterless ---traditional tuning
methods are problematic in streaming settings--- and avoid requiring prior
knowledge of the number of distinct class labels occurring in the stream. In
this paper, we introduce a new algorithmic approach for nonparametric learning
in data streams. Our approach addresses all above mentioned challenges by
learning a model that covers the input space using simple local classifiers.
The distribution of these classifiers dynamically adapts to the local (unknown)
complexity of the classification problem, thus achieving a good balance between
model complexity and predictive accuracy. We design four variants of our
approach of increasing adaptivity. By means of an extensive empirical
evaluation against standard nonparametric baselines, we show state-of-the-art
results in terms of accuracy versus model size. For the variant that imposes a
strict bound on the model size, we show better performance against all other
methods measured at the same model size value. Our empirical analysis is
complemented by a theoretical performance guarantee which does not rely on any

anomalous behavior, often referred to as anomaly detection. Similarity-based
anomaly detection algorithms detect abnormally large amounts of similarity or
dissimilarity, e.g.~as measured by nearest neighbor Euclidean distances between
a test sample and the training samples. In many application domains there may
not exist a single dissimilarity measure that captures all possible anomalous
patterns. In such cases, multiple dissimilarity measures can be defined,
including non-metric measures, and one can test for anomalies by scalarizing
using a non-negative linear combination of them. If the relative importance of
the different dissimilarity measures are not known in advance, as in many
anomaly detection applications, the anomaly detection algorithm may need to be
executed multiple times with different choices of weights in the linear
combination. In this paper, we propose a method for similarity-based anomaly
detection using a novel multi-criteria dissimilarity measure, the Pareto depth.
The proposed Pareto depth analysis (PDA) anomaly detection algorithm uses the
concept of Pareto optimality to detect anomalies under multiple criteria
without having to run an algorithm multiple times with different choices of
weights. The proposed PDA approach is provably better than using linear
combinations of the criteria and shows superior performance on experiments with

functions, where each time series is represented by a vertex and the most
similar ones are connected. Then, we apply community detection algorithms to
identify groups of strongly connected vertices (called a community) and,
consequently, identify time series clusters. Still in this paper, we make a
comprehensive analysis on the influence of various combinations of time series
distance functions, network generation methods and community detection
techniques on clustering results. Experimental study shows that the proposed
network-based approach achieves better results than various classic or
up-to-date clustering techniques under consideration. Statistical tests confirm
that the proposed method outperforms some classic clustering algorithms, such
as $k$-medoids, diana, median-linkage and centroid-linkage in various data
sets. Interestingly, the proposed method can effectively detect shape patterns
presented in time series due to the topological structure of the underlying
network constructed in the clustering process. At the same time, other
techniques fail to identify such patterns. Moreover, the proposed method is
robust enough to group time series presenting similar pattern but with time
shifts and/or amplitude variations. In summary, the main point of the proposed
method is the transformation of time series from time-space domain to
topological domain. Therefore, we hope that our approach contributes not only

interest in recent years. It has a wide variety of applications in disease

graph representation alone. However, in many real-world applications, the side
information is available along with the graph data. For example, for
neurological disorder identification, in addition to the brain networks derived
from neuroimaging data, hundreds of clinical, immunologic, serologic and
cognitive measures may also be documented for each subject. These measures
compose multiple side views encoding a tremendous amount of supplemental
information for diagnostic purposes, yet are often ignored. In this paper, we
study the problem of discriminative subgraph selection using multiple side
views and propose a novel solution to find an optimal set of subgraph features
for graph classification by exploring a plurality of side views. We derive a
feature evaluation criterion, named gSide, to estimate the usefulness of
subgraph patterns based upon side views. Then we develop a branch-and-bound

integrating the subgraph mining process and the procedure of discriminative

deep network approaches provide great advantages in terms of learning power and
speed, but previously it has been unclear how to use them to separate signals
in a class-independent way. In contrast, spectral clustering approaches are
flexible with respect to the classes and number of items to be segmented, but
it has been unclear how to leverage the learning power and speed of deep
networks. To obtain the best of both worlds, we use an objective function that
to train embeddings that yield a low-rank approximation to an ideal pairwise

spectral factorization and instead produces compact clusters that are amenable
to simple clustering methods. The segmentations are therefore implicitly
encoded in the embeddings, and can be ""decoded"" by clustering. Preliminary
experiments show that the proposed method can separate speech: when trained on
spectrogram features containing mixtures of two speakers, and tested on
mixtures of a held-out set of speakers, it can infer masking functions that
improve signal quality by around 6dB. We show that the model can generalize to
three-speaker mixtures despite training only on two-speaker mixtures. The

patterns of collective motion, the current battery of nonlinear dimensionality
reduction methods are not amenable to the analysis of such manifolds. This is
mainly due to the necessary spectral decomposition step, which limits control
over the mapping from the original high-dimensional space to the embedding
space. Here, we propose an alternative approach that demands a two-dimensional
embedding which topologically summarizes the high-dimensional data. In this
sense, our approach is closely related to the construction of one-dimensional
principal curves that minimize orthogonal error to data points subject to
smoothness constraints. Specifically, we construct a two-dimensional principal
manifold directly in the high-dimensional space using cubic smoothing splines,
and define the embedding coordinates in terms of geodesic distances. Thus, the
mapping from the high-dimensional data to the manifold is defined in terms of
local coordinates. Through representative examples, we show that compared to
existing nonlinear dimensionality reduction methods, the principal manifold
retains the original structure even in noisy and sparse datasets. The principal
manifold finding algorithm is applied to configurations obtained from a
dynamical system of multiple agents simulating a complex maneuver called
predator mobbing, and the resulting two-dimensional embedding is compared with
that of a well-established nonlinear dimensionality reduction method.","['Kelum Gajamannage', 'Sachit Butail', 'Maurizio Porfiri', 'Erik M. Bollt']","['math.NA', 'cs.LG', 'cs.MA', 'math.DS', 'stat.ML', '57M60 (Primary), 37E99, 57N35 (Secondary)']",2015-08-13 21:07:51+00:00

specific task of choosing among distributions to use for random hyperparameter

which deals with sequentially choosing which distribution from a collection to
sample in order to minimize (maximize) the single best cost (reward). Whereas
the distributions in the standard bandit setting are primarily characterized by
their means, a number of subtleties arise when we care about the minimal cost
as opposed to the average cost. For example, there may not be a well-defined
""best"" distribution as there is in the standard bandit setting. The best
distribution depends on the rewards that have been obtained and on the
remaining time horizon. Whereas in the standard bandit setting, it is sensible
to compare policies with an oracle which plays the single best arm, in the
extreme bandit setting, there are multiple sensible oracle models. We define a
sensible notion of ""extreme regret"" in the extreme bandit setting, which
parallels the concept of regret in the standard bandit setting. We then prove

telcos to maintain or grow their market share, by providing users with as good
an experience as possible on their network.
  But the task of extracting customer insights from the vast amounts of data
collected by telcos is growing in complexity and scale everey day. How can we
measure and predict the quality of a user's experience on a telco network in
real-time? That is the problem that we address in this paper.
  We present an approach to capture, in (near) real-time, the mobile customer
experience in order to assess which conditions lead the user to place a call to
a telco's customer care center. To this end, we follow a supervised learning
approach for prediction and train our 'Restricted Random Forest' model using,
as a proxy for bad experience, the observed customer transactions in the telco
data feed before the user places a call to a customer care center.
  We evaluate our approach using a rich dataset provided by a major African
telecommunication's company and a novel big data architecture for both the

solution to be effective at predicting user experience by inferring if a
customer will place a call based on his current context.

regression in the high-dimensional regime $p\gg n$. In this context, we would
like to perform inference on a high-dimensional parameters vector
$\theta^*\in{\mathbb R}^p$. Important progress has been achieved in computing
confidence intervals for single coordinates $\theta^*_i$. A key role in these
new methods is played by a certain debiased estimator $\hat{\theta}^{\rm d}$
that is constructed from the Lasso. Earlier work establishes that, under
suitable assumptions on the design matrix, the coordinates of
$\hat{\theta}^{\rm d}$ are asymptotically Gaussian provided $\theta^*$ is
$s_0$-sparse with $s_0 = o(\sqrt{n}/\log p )$. The condition $s_0 = o(\sqrt{n}/
\log p )$ is stronger than the one for consistent estimation, namely $s_0 =
o(n/ \log p)$. We study Gaussian designs with known or unknown population
covariance. When the covariance is known, we prove that the debiased estimator
is asymptotically Gaussian under the nearly optimal condition $s_0 = o(n/ (\log
p)^2)$. Note that earlier work was limited to $s_0 = o(\sqrt{n}/\log p)$ even
for perfectly known covariance. The same conclusion holds if the population
covariance is unknown but can be estimated sufficiently well, e.g. under the
same sparsity conditions on the inverse covariance as assumed by earlier work.
For intermediate regimes, we describe the trade-off between sparsity in the
coefficients and in the inverse covariance of the design. We further discuss
several applications of our results to high-dimensional inference. In

be efficient in the sense that its prediction performance is asymptotically
equivalent to the best offered by the candidate models; in this case, the new
criterion behaves in a similar manner. Different from the two classical
criteria, the proposed criterion adaptively achieves either consistency or
efficiency depending on the underlying true model. In practice where the

for finding large independent sets in sparse random regular graphs. Montanari
(2015) showed that local algorithms are suboptimal for finding a community with
high connectivity in the sparse Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi random graphs. For the
symmetric planted partition problem (also named community detection for the
block models) on sparse graphs, a simple observation is that local algorithms
cannot have non-trivial performance.
  In this work we consider the effect of side information on local algorithms
for community detection under the binary symmetric stochastic block model. In
the block model with side information each of the $n$ vertices is labeled $+$
or $-$ independently and uniformly at random; each pair of vertices is
connected independently with probability $a/n$ if both of them have the same
label or $b/n$ otherwise. The goal is to estimate the underlying vertex
labeling given 1) the graph structure and 2) side information in the form of a
vertex labeling positively correlated with the true one. Assuming that the
ratio between in and out degree $a/b$ is $\Theta(1)$ and the average degree $
(a+b) / 2 = n^{o(1)}$, we characterize three different regimes under which a
local algorithm, namely, belief propagation run on the local neighborhoods,
maximizes the expected fraction of vertices labeled correctly. Thus, in

algebraic methods for an adaptive tubal-sampling of this fingerprint space. In
particular using a recently proposed tensor algebraic framework in [1] we

adaptivity to identify reference points which are highly informative for
learning this low-dimensional space. Further, under certain incoherency
conditions we prove that the proposed scheme achieves bounded recovery error

to significant improvements in localization accuracy. The approach is validated

similar if they have similar associations will all other variables. This can
arise, for instance, when groups of variables are noise corrupted versions of

The acoustic model is a neural network used for estimating the probabilities of

model is general and can be used to transcribe polyphonic music without
imposing any constraints on the polyphony. The acoustic and language model

compare performance of the neural network based acoustic models with two

classifiers. In particular, we assume a model where one observes signals in the
presence of isotropic Gaussian noise and the distribution of the signals
conditioned on a given class is Gaussian with a zero mean and a low-rank
covariance matrix. We also assume that the classifier knows only a mismatched
version of the parameters of input distribution in lieu of the true parameters.
By constructing an asymptotic low-noise expansion of an upper bound to the
error probability of such a mismatched classifier, we provide sufficient
conditions for reliable classification in the low-noise regime that are able to
sharply predict the absence of a classification error floor. Such conditions
are a function of the geometry of the true signal distribution, the geometry of
the mismatched signal distributions as well as the interplay between such
geometries, namely, the principal angles and the overlap between the true and
the mismatched signal subspaces. Numerical results demonstrate that our
conditions for reliable classification can sharply predict the behavior of a
mismatched classifier both with synthetic data and in a motion segmentation and

are characterized by two main sources of uncertainties--internal and model
variabilities. Using an ensemble of climate model simulations from the CMIP5
decadal experiments, we quantified the total uncertainty associated with these
predictions and the relative importance of each source. Annual and monthly
averages of the surface temperature and wind components were considered. We
show that different definitions of the anomaly results in different conclusions
regarding the variance of the ensemble members. However, some features of the
uncertainty are common to all the measures we considered. We found that over
decadal time scales, there is no considerable increase in the uncertainty with
time. The model variability is more sensitive to the annual cycle than the
internal variability. This, in turn, results in a maximal uncertainty during
the winter in the northern hemisphere. The uncertainty of the surface
temperature prediction is dominated by the model variability, whereas the
uncertainty of the wind components is determined by both sources. Analysis of
the spatial distribution of the uncertainty reveals that the surface
temperature has higher variability over land and in high latitudes, whereas the
surface zonal wind has higher variability over the ocean. The relative
importance of the internal and model variabilities depends on the averaging
period, the definition of the anomaly, and the location. These findings suggest
that several methods should be combined in order to assess future climate
prediction uncertainties and that weighting schemes of the ensemble members may
reduce the uncertainties.","['Ehud Strobach', 'Golan Bel']","['physics.ao-ph', 'physics.data-an', 'stat.ML']",2015-08-07 05:36:04+00:00

such regions can be inferred from fluorescence measurements obtained by binding

Similarity-based Imbalanced Classification (SBIC) that learns patterns in the

absent data, i.e. data from the minority class which can help better find the
boundary between the two classes. SBIC simultaneously optimizes the weights of
the empirical similarity function and finds the locations of absent data
points. As such, SBIC uses an embedded mechanism for synthetic data generation
which does not modify the training dataset, but alters the algorithm to suit
imbalanced datasets. Therefore, SBIC uses the ideas of both major schools of
thoughts in imbalanced classification: Like cost-sensitive approaches SBIC
operates on an algorithm level to handle imbalanced structures; and similar to
synthetic data generation approaches, it utilizes the properties of unobserved

learning because they are more accurate than linear models. Variable selection
for kernel regression models is a challenge partly because, unlike the linear
regression setting, there is no clear concept of an effect size for regression
coefficients. In this paper, we propose a novel framework that provides an
effect size analog of each explanatory variable for Bayesian kernel regression
models when the kernel is shift-invariant --- for example, the Gaussian kernel.
We use function analytic properties of shift-invariant reproducing kernel
Hilbert spaces (RKHS) to define a linear vector space that: (i) captures
nonlinear structure, and (ii) can be projected onto the original explanatory
variables. The projection onto the original explanatory variables serves as an
analog of effect sizes. The specific function analytic property we use is that
shift-invariant kernel functions can be approximated via random Fourier bases.
Based on the random Fourier expansion we propose a computationally efficient
class of Bayesian approximate kernel regression (BAKR) models for both
nonlinear regression and binary classification for which one can compute an
analog of effect sizes. We illustrate the utility of BAKR by examining two
important problems in statistical genetics: genomic selection (i.e. phenotypic
prediction) and association mapping (i.e. inference of significant variants or
loci). State-of-the-art methods for genomic selection and association mapping

subspace of the input space such that the projected input variables preserve
maximal information about the output variables. The dependence maximization
approach solves the supervised dimension reduction problem through maximizing a
statistical dependence between projected input variables and output variables.
A well-known statistical dependence measure is mutual information (MI) which is
based on the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence. However, it is known that the KL
divergence is sensitive to outliers. On the other hand, quadratic MI (QMI) is a
variant of MI based on the $L_2$ distance which is more robust against outliers
than the KL divergence, and a computationally efficient method to estimate QMI
from data, called least-squares QMI (LSQMI), has been proposed recently. For
these reasons, developing a supervised dimension reduction method based on
LSQMI seems promising. However, not QMI itself, but the derivative of QMI is
needed for subspace search in supervised dimension reduction, and the
derivative of an accurate QMI estimator is not necessarily a good estimator of
the derivative of QMI. In this paper, we propose to directly estimate the
derivative of QMI without estimating QMI itself. We show that the direct

interpretation, we propose a novel family of listwise, large margin ranking
surrogates. Members of this family can be thought of as analogs of the hinge
loss. Exploiting a certain self-bounding property of the proposed family, we
provide a guarantee on the cumulative NDCG (or AP) induced loss incurred by our

ranker which can correctly rank each instance in an online sequence of ranking
data, with some margin, the cumulative loss of perceptron algorithm on that
sequence is bounded by a constant, irrespective of the length of the sequence.
This result is reminiscent of Novikoff's convergence theorem for the
classification perceptron. Moreover, we prove a lower bound on the cumulative
loss achievable by any deterministic algorithm, under the assumption of
existence of perfect oracle ranker. The lower bound shows that our perceptron

allow to integrate possible prior knowledge on the data structure and
constitute a good alternative to recent mixture of spatial spline regressions
model estimated in a maximum likelihood framework via the
expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm. The Bayesian model inference is
performed by Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling. We derive two Gibbs
sampler to infer the BSSR and the BMSSR models and apply them on simulated
surfaces and a real problem of handwritten digit recognition using the MNIST
data set. The obtained results highlight the potential benefit of the proposed
Bayesian approaches for modeling surfaces possibly dispersed in particular in
clusters.",['Faicel Chamroukhi'],"['stat.ME', 'cs.LG', 'stat.CO', 'stat.ML', '62-XX, 62Fxx, 62F15, 62H30']",2015-08-04 01:29:49+00:00
