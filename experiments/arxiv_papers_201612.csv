to analyzing high-dimensional data sets. However, due to memory limitations,
existing R packages like glmnet and ncvreg are not capable of fitting
lasso-type models for ultrahigh-dimensional, multi-gigabyte data sets that are
increasingly seen in many areas such as genetics, genomics, biomedical imaging,
and high-frequency finance. In this research, we implement an R package called
biglasso that tackles this challenge. biglasso utilizes memory-mapped files to
store the massive data on the disk, only reading data into memory when
necessary during model fitting, and is thus able to handle out-of-core
computation seamlessly. Moreover, it's equipped with newly proposed, more
efficient feature screening rules, which substantially accelerate the
computation. Benchmarking experiments show that our biglasso package, as
compared to existing popular ones like glmnet, is much more memory- and
computation-efficient. We further analyze a 31 GB real data set on a laptop
with only 16 GB RAM to demonstrate the out-of-core computation capability of
biglasso in analyzing massive data sets that cannot be accommodated by existing
R packages.","['Yaohui Zeng', 'Patrick Breheny']","['stat.CO', 'stat.ML']",2017-01-20 22:08:49+00:00

community and simulated physical processes in High Energy Particle Physics by
applying a novel Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) architecture to the
production of jet images -- 2D representations of energy depositions from
particles interacting with a calorimeter. We propose a simple architecture, the
Location-Aware Generative Adversarial Network, that learns to produce realistic
radiation patterns from simulated high energy particle collisions. The pixel
intensities of GAN-generated images faithfully span over many orders of
magnitude and exhibit the desired low-dimensional physical properties (i.e.,
jet mass, n-subjettiness, etc.). We shed light on limitations, and provide a
novel empirical validation of image quality and validity of GAN-produced
simulations of the natural world. This work provides a base for further
explorations of GANs for use in faster simulation in High Energy Particle

http://arxiv.org/abs/1701.05804v4,Disentangling group and link persistence in Dynamic Stochastic Block models,"We study the inference of a model of dynamic networks in which both
communities and links keep memory of previous network states. By considering
maximum likelihood inference from single snapshot observations of the network,
we show that link persistence makes the inference of communities harder,
decreasing the detectability threshold, while community persistence tends to
make it easier. We analytically show that communities inferred from single
network snapshot can share a maximum overlap with the underlying communities of
a specific previous instant in time. This leads to time-lagged inference: the
identification of past communities rather than present ones. Finally we compute
the time lag and propose a corrected algorithm, the Lagged Snapshot Dynamic
(LSD) algorithm, for community detection in dynamic networks. We analytically
and numerically characterize the detectability transitions of such algorithm as
a function of the memory parameters of the model and we make a comparison with
a full dynamic inference.","['Paolo Barucca', 'Fabrizio Lillo', 'Piero Mazzarisi', 'Daniele Tantari']","['cs.SI', 'cs.LG', 'physics.soc-ph', 'stat.ML']",2017-01-20 14:33:45+00:00

distributions. Unlike p-values, they can convey information both about
statistical significance as well as effect size. However, very little work
exists on applying confidence intervals to multivariate data. In this paper we
define confidence intervals for multivariate data that extend the
one-dimensional definition in a natural way. In our definition every variable
is associated with its own confidence interval as usual, but a data vector can
be outside of a few of these, and still be considered to be within the
confidence area. We analyze the problem and show that the resulting confidence
areas retain the good qualities of their one-dimensional counterparts: they are
informative and easy to interpret. Furthermore, we show that the problem of
finding multivariate confidence intervals is hard, but provide efficient
approximate algorithms to solve the problem.","['Jussi Korpela', 'Emilia Oikarinen', 'Kai Puolamäki', 'Antti Ukkonen']","['stat.AP', 'stat.ML', '62G15, 62H99, 62M10,', 'G.3']",2017-01-20 11:19:50+00:00
http://arxiv.org/abs/1701.05672v1,Stability Enhanced Large-Margin Classifier Selection,"Stability is an important aspect of a classification procedure because
unstable predictions can potentially reduce users' trust in a classification
system and also harm the reproducibility of scientific conclusions. The major
goal of our work is to introduce a novel concept of classification instability,
i.e., decision boundary instability (DBI), and incorporate it with the
generalization error (GE) as a standard for selecting the most accurate and
stable classifier. Specifically, we implement a two-stage algorithm: (i)
initially select a subset of classifiers whose estimated GEs are not
significantly different from the minimal estimated GE among all the candidate
classifiers; (ii) the optimal classifier is chosen as the one achieving the
minimal DBI among the subset selected in stage (i). This general selection
principle applies to both linear and nonlinear classifiers. Large-margin
classifiers are used as a prototypical example to illustrate the above idea.
Our selection method is shown to be consistent in the sense that the optimal
classifier simultaneously achieves the minimal GE and the minimal DBI. Various
simulations and real examples further demonstrate the advantage of our method
over several alternative approaches.","['Will Wei Sun', 'Guang Cheng', 'Yufeng Liu']",['stat.ML'],2017-01-20 03:38:57+00:00

http://arxiv.org/abs/1701.05644v1,Rare Disease Physician Targeting: A Factor Graph Approach,"In rare disease physician targeting, a major challenge is how to identify
physicians who are treating diagnosed or underdiagnosed rare diseases patients.
Rare diseases have extremely low incidence rate. For a specified rare disease,
only a small number of patients are affected and a fractional of physicians are
involved. The existing targeting methodologies, such as segmentation and
profiling, are developed under mass market assumption. They are not suitable
for rare disease market where the target classes are extremely imbalanced. The
authors propose a graphical model approach to predict targets by jointly
modeling physician and patient features from different data spaces and
utilizing the extra relational information. Through an empirical example with
medical claim and prescription data, the proposed approach demonstrates better
accuracy in finding target physicians. The graph representation also provides
visual interpretability of relationship among physicians and patients. The
model can be extended to incorporate more complex dependency structures. This

humanity has become linked by a single, open, communications platform.
Harnessing this fact, we report insights arising from a unified internet
activity and location dataset of an unparalleled scope and accuracy drawn from
over a trillion (1.5$\times 10^{12}$) observations of end-user internet
connections, with temporal resolution of just 15min over 2006-2012. We first
apply this dataset to the expansion of the internet itself over 1,647 urban
agglomerations globally. We find that unique IP per capita counts reach
saturation at approximately one IP per three people, and take, on average, 16.1
years to achieve; eclipsing the estimated 100- and 60- year saturation times
for steam-power and electrification respectively. Next, we use intra-diurnal
internet activity features to up-scale traditional over-night sleep
observations, producing the first global estimate of over-night sleep duration
in 645 cities over 7 years. We find statistically significant variation between
continental, national and regional sleep durations including some evidence of
global sleep duration convergence. Finally, we estimate the relationship
between internet concentration and economic outcomes in 411 OECD regions and
find that the internet's expansion is associated with negative or positive
productivity gains, depending strongly on sectoral considerations. To our
knowledge, our study is the first of its kind to use online/offline activity of
the entire internet to infer social science insights, demonstrating the
unparalleled potential of the internet as a social data-science platform.","['Klaus Ackermann', 'Simon D Angus', 'Paul A Raschky']","['q-fin.EC', 'cs.CY', 'cs.SI', 'physics.soc-ph', 'stat.ML']",2017-01-19 22:35:46+00:00

by which one can both capture the non-linearity in data and also find the best

selection method should have the potential of adding a supplementary level of
regression analysis that would capture complex relationships in the data via
mathematical transformation of the predictors and exploration of synergistic
effects of combined variables. The method that we present here has the
potential to produce an optimal subset of variables, rendering the overall
process of model selection to be more efficient. The core objective of this
paper is to introduce a new estimation technique for the classical least square
regression framework. This new automatic variable transformation and model
selection method could offer an optimal and stable model that minimizes the
mean square error and variability, while combining all possible subset
selection methodology and including variable transformations and interaction.
Moreover, this novel method controls multicollinearity, leading to an optimal

directly modeling the response. We find accurate estimation of individual

to be adaptive to confounding, when used in parallel with out-of-sample
estimation, do best. One method found to be especially promising is
counterfactual synthetic forests. We illustrate this new methodology by

a surrogate $S$ which, while not being strongly predictive of $Y$ throughout

extreme values. Such datasets arise naturally in modern studies involving large
databases such as electronic medical records (EMR) where $Y$, unlike

an example of $Y$ and $S$ would be the true disease phenotype and the count of

settings. This approach, whose origins can be traced to machine learning, is
based on the leave-one-out bootstrap for prediction error. In machine learning
this is called the out-of-bag (OOB) error. To obtain the OOB error for a model,
one draws a bootstrap sample and fits the model to the in-sample data. The
out-of-sample prediction error for the model is obtained by calculating the
prediction error for the model using the out-of-sample data. Repeating and
averaging yields the OOB error, which represents a robust cross-validated
estimate of the accuracy of the underlying model. By a simple modification to
the bootstrap data involving ""noising up"" a variable, the OOB method yields a
variable importance (VIMP) index, which directly measures how much a specific
variable contributes to the prediction precision of a model. VIMP provides a
scientifically interpretable measure of the effect size of a variable, we call
the ""predictive effect size"", that holds whether the researcher's model is
correct or not, unlike the p-value whose calculation is based on the assumed
correctness of the model. We also discuss a marginal VIMP index, also easily
calculated, which measures the marginal effect of a variable, or what we call
""the discovery effect"". The OOB procedure can be applied to both parametric and
nonparametric regression models and requires only that the researcher can
repeatedly fit their model to bootstrap and modified bootstrap data. We
illustrate this approach on a survival data set involving patients with
systolic heart failure and to a simulated survival data set where the model is

http://arxiv.org/abs/1701.04889v2,Efficient and Adaptive Linear Regression in Semi-Supervised Settings,"We consider the linear regression problem under semi-supervised settings
wherein the available data typically consists of: (i) a small or moderate sized
'labeled' data, and (ii) a much larger sized 'unlabeled' data. Such data arises
naturally from settings where the outcome, unlike the covariates, is expensive
to obtain, a frequent scenario in modern studies involving large databases like
electronic medical records (EMR). Supervised estimators like the ordinary least
squares (OLS) estimator utilize only the labeled data. It is often of interest
to investigate if and when the unlabeled data can be exploited to improve
estimation of the regression parameter in the adopted linear model.
  In this paper, we propose a class of 'Efficient and Adaptive Semi-Supervised
Estimators' (EASE) to improve estimation efficiency. The EASE are two-step
estimators adaptive to model mis-specification, leading to improved (optimal in
some cases) efficiency under model mis-specification, and equal (optimal)
efficiency under a linear model. This adaptive property, often unaddressed in
the existing literature, is crucial for advocating 'safe' use of the unlabeled
data. The construction of EASE primarily involves a flexible
'semi-non-parametric' imputation, including a smoothing step that works well
even when the number of covariates is not small; and a follow up 'refitting'
step along with a cross-validation (CV) strategy both of which have useful
practical as well as theoretical implications towards addressing two important
issues: under-smoothing and over-fitting. We establish asymptotic results
including consistency, asymptotic normality and the adaptive properties of
EASE. We also provide influence function expansions and a 'double' CV strategy
for inference. The results are further validated through extensive simulations,
followed by application to an EMR study on auto-immunity.","['Abhishek Chakrabortty', 'Tianxi Cai']","['stat.ME', 'math.ST', 'stat.ML', 'stat.TH', '62F35, 62J05, 62F10, 62F12, 62G08']",2017-01-17 22:29:22+00:00

idiopathic scoliosis from 3D spine models reconstructed from biplanar X-ray
images. Recent progress in machine learning have allowed to improve
classification and prognosis rates, but lack a probabilistic framework to
measure uncertainty in the data. We propose a discriminative probabilistic
manifold embedding where locally linear mappings transform data points from
high-dimensional space to corresponding low-dimensional coordinates. A
discriminant adjacency matrix is constructed to maximize the separation between
progressive and non-progressive groups of patients diagnosed with scoliosis,
while minimizing the distance in latent variables belonging to the same class.
To predict the evolution of deformation, a baseline reconstruction is projected
onto the manifold, from which a spatiotemporal regression model is built from
parallel transport curves inferred from neighboring exemplars. Rate of
progression is modulated from the spine flexibility and curve magnitude of the
3D spine deformation. The method was tested on 745 reconstructions from 133
subjects using longitudinal 3D reconstructions of the spine, with results
demonstrating the discriminatory framework can identify between progressive and
non-progressive of scoliotic patients with a classification rate of 81% and
prediction differences of 2.1$^{o}$ in main curve angulation, outperforming
other manifold learning methods. Our method achieved a higher prediction

based, which supports both types of learning viz., online and offline learning.
Out of various proposed methods, four are offline and remaining two are online

mapping and two methods perform kernel feature mapping. Kernel feature mapping
based approaches have been tested with RBF kernel and online version of
one-class classifiers are tested with both types of nodes viz., additive and

constant approximation of the optimal squared error
\min_{\beta}\|Y-X\beta\|_{2}, where the minimization is over all k-sparse
binary vectors \beta. The approximation reveals interesting structural
properties of the underlying regression problem. In particular, a) We establish
that n^*=2k\log p/\log (2k/\sigma^{2}+1) is a phase transition point with the
following ""all-or-nothing"" property. When n exceeds n^{*},
(2k)^{-1}\|\beta_{2}-\beta^*\|_0\approx 0, and when n is below n^{*},
(2k)^{-1}\|\beta_{2}-\beta^*\|_0\approx 1, where \beta_2 is the optimal

then examples are fed into an engine that executes this computation and
computes its derivatives. In DyNet's dynamic declaration strategy, computation
graph construction is mostly transparent, being implicitly constructed by
executing procedural code that computes the network outputs, and the user is
free to use different network structures for each input. Dynamic declaration

paper deals with online convex optimization involving adversarial loss
functions and adversarial constraints, where the constraints are revealed after
making decisions, and can be tolerable to instantaneous violations but must be
satisfied in the long term. Performance of an online algorithm in this setting
is assessed by: i) the difference of its losses relative to the best dynamic
solution with one-slot-ahead information of the loss function and the
constraint (that is here termed dynamic regret); and, ii) the accumulated
amount of constraint violations (that is here termed dynamic fit). In this
context, a modified online saddle-point (MOSP) scheme is developed, and proved
to simultaneously yield sub-linear dynamic regret and fit, provided that the
accumulated variations of per-slot minimizers and constraints are sub-linearly

multimodal sensors has drawn significant research attention over the years. In
this paper, we focus on a particular problem setting consisting of a physical
phenomenon or a system of interest observed by multiple sensors. We assume that
all sensors measure some aspects of the system of interest with additional
sensor-specific and irrelevant components. Our goal is to recover the variables
relevant to the observed system and to filter out the nuisance effects of the
sensor-specific variables. We propose an approach based on manifold learning,
which is particularly suitable for problems with multiple modalities, since it
aims to capture the intrinsic structure of the data and relies on minimal prior
model knowledge. Specifically, we propose a nonlinear filtering scheme, which
extracts the hidden sources of variability captured by two or more sensors,
that are independent of the sensor-specific components. In addition to
presenting a theoretical analysis, we demonstrate our technique on real
measured data for the purpose of sleep stage assessment based on multiple,
multimodal sensor measurements. We show that without prior knowledge on the
different modalities and on the measured system, our method gives rise to a
data-driven representation that is well correlated with the underlying sleep
process and is robust to noise and sensor-specific effects.","['Ori Katz', 'Ronen Talmon', 'Yu-Lun Lo', 'Hau-Tieng Wu']","['stat.ML', 'cs.LG', 'physics.data-an', '62-07']",2017-01-13 10:45:01+00:00

recognition and compare their performance to deep neural networks (DNNs). We
perform experiments on four speech recognition datasets, including the TIMIT
and Broadcast News benchmark tasks, and compare these two types of models on
frame-level performance metrics (accuracy, cross-entropy), as well as on
recognition metrics (word/character error rate). In order to scale kernel
methods to these large datasets, we use the random Fourier feature method of
Rahimi and Recht (2007). We propose two novel techniques for improving the
performance of kernel acoustic models. First, in order to reduce the number of
random features required by kernel models, we propose a simple but effective
method for feature selection. The method is able to explore a large number of
non-linear features while maintaining a compact model more efficiently than
existing approaches. Second, we present a number of frame-level metrics which
correlate very strongly with recognition performance when computed on the
heldout set; we take advantage of these correlations by monitoring these
metrics during training in order to decide when to stop learning. This
technique can noticeably improve the recognition performance of both DNN and
kernel models, while narrowing the gap between them. Additionally, we show that
the linear bottleneck method of Sainath et al. (2013) improves the performance
of our kernel models significantly, in addition to speeding up training and
making the models more compact. Together, these three methods dramatically
improve the performance of kernel acoustic models, making their performance
comparable to DNNs on the tasks we explored.","['Avner May', 'Alireza Bagheri Garakani', 'Zhiyun Lu', 'Dong Guo', 'Kuan Liu', 'Aurélien Bellet', 'Linxi Fan', 'Michael Collins', 'Daniel Hsu', 'Brian Kingsbury', 'Michael Picheny', 'Fei Sha']","['stat.ML', 'cs.AI', 'cs.CL', 'cs.LG']",2017-01-13 07:24:18+00:00

incomplete modal data where we can impose spatially-sparse stiffness changes
when updating a structural model. To this end, based on a similar hierarchical
sparse Bayesian learning model from our previous work, we propose two Gibbs
sampling algorithms. The algorithms differ in their strategies to deal with the
posterior uncertainty of the equation-error precision parameter, but both
sample from the conditional posterior probability density functions (PDFs) for
the structural stiffness parameters and system modal parameters. The effective
dimension for the Gibbs sampling is low because iterative sampling is done from
only three conditional posterior PDFs that correspond to three parameter
groups, along with sampling of the equation-error precision parameter from
another conditional posterior PDF in one of the algorithms where it is not
integrated out as a ""nuisance"" parameter. A nice feature from a computational
perspective is that it is not necessary to solve a nonlinear eigenvalue problem
of a structural model. The effectiveness and robustness of the proposed
algorithms are illustrated by applying them to the IASE-ASCE Phase II simulated
and experimental benchmark studies. The goal is to use incomplete modal data
identified before and after possible damage to detect and assess
spatially-sparse stiffness reductions induced by any damage. Our past and
current focus on meeting challenges arising from Bayesian inference of
structural stiffness serve to strengthen the capability of vibration-based
structural system identification but our methods also have much broader

theorem that guarantees the correctness of transferring knowledge; and (2) a
principal angle-based metric to measure the distance between two pairs of
domains: one pair comprises the original source and target domains and the
other pair comprises two homogeneous representations of two domains. The
theorem and the metric have been implemented in an innovative transfer model,

The linear monotonic maps meet the conditions of the theorem and are used to
construct homogeneous representations of the heterogeneous domains. The metric
shows the extent to which the homogeneous representations have preserved the
information in the original source and target domains. By minimizing the

heterogeneous domains and transfers knowledge through these learned

GAN algorithm on a reweighted sample. This is inspired by boosting algorithms,
where many potentially weak individual predictors are greedily aggregated to
form a strong composite predictor. We prove that such an incremental procedure

each step is optimal, and convergence at an exponential rate otherwise. We also
illustrate experimentally that this procedure addresses the problem of missing

(1) A smaller model size, which is more tenable on memory constrained systems;
(2) A significantly faster network which is more tenable on computationally
constrained systems; (3) A high accuracy of 95.7 percent on the CIFAR-10

misclassification can be too costly to afford; in this case, a reject option,
which defers the decision until further investigation is conducted, is often
preferred. In recent years, there has been much development for binary
classification with a reject option. Yet, little progress has been made for the
multicategory case. In this article, we propose margin-based multicategory
classification methods with a reject option. In addition, and more importantly,
we introduce a new and unique refine option for the multicategory problem,
where the class of an observation is predicted to be from a set of class
labels, whose cardinality is not necessarily one. The main advantage of both
options lies in their capacity of identifying error-prone observations.
Moreover, the refine option can provide more constructive information for
classification by effectively ruling out implausible classes. Efficient
implementations have been developed for the proposed methods. On the
theoretical side, we offer a novel statistical learning theory and show a fast
convergence rate of the excess $\ell$-risk of our methods with emphasis on
diverging dimensionality and number of classes. The results can be further
improved under a low noise assumption. A set of comprehensive simulation and

distribution is, however, not available from these models. A more general
understanding of regression models as models for conditional distributions
allows much broader inference from such models, for example the computation of
prediction intervals. Several random forest-type algorithms aim at estimating
conditional distributions, most prominently quantile regression forests
(Meinshausen, 2006, JMLR). We propose a novel approach based on a parametric
family of distributions characterised by their transformation function. A
dedicated novel ""transformation tree"" algorithm able to detect distributional
changes is developed. Based on these transformation trees, we introduce
""transformation forests"" as an adaptive local likelihood estimator of

different applied fields such as bioinformatics, error-control codes, speech
language, information retrieval and others. Gaussian graphical model selection
is a statistical problem to identify the Gaussian graphical model from a sample
of a given size. Different approaches for Gaussian graphical model selection
are suggested in the literature. One of them is based on considering the family
of individual conditional independence tests. The application of this approach
leads to the construction of a variety of multiple testing statistical
procedures for Gaussian graphical model selection. An important characteristic
of these procedures is its error rate for a given sample size. In existing
literature great attention is paid to the control of error rates for incorrect
edge inclusion (Type I error). However, in graphical model selection it is also
important to take into account error rates for incorrect edge exclusion (Type
II error). To deal with this issue we consider the graphical model selection
problem in the framework of the multiple decision theory. The quality of
statistical procedures is measured by a risk function with additive losses.
Additive losses allow both types of errors to be taken into account. We
construct the tests of a Neyman structure for individual hypotheses and combine
them to obtain a multiple decision statistical procedure. We show that the
obtained procedure is optimal in the sense that it minimizes the linear
combination of expected numbers of Type I and Type II errors in the class of
unbiased multiple decision procedures.","['Valery A. Kalyagin', 'Alexander P. Koldanov', 'Petr A. Koldanov', 'Panos M. Pardalos']","['stat.ML', '62-09, 62H15, 62C05']",2017-01-09 06:34:00+00:00

in with linearized radial basis function (RBF) kernel. On a large number of
classification tasks, the tuning-free GMM kernel performs (surprisingly) well
compared to the best-tuned RBF kernel. Nevertheless, one would naturally expect
that the GMM kernel ought to be further improved if we introduce tuning
parameters.
  In this paper, we study three simple constructions of tunable GMM kernels:
(i) the exponentiated-GMM (or eGMM) kernel, (ii) the powered-GMM (or pGMM)
kernel, and (iii) the exponentiated-powered-GMM (epGMM) kernel. The pGMM kernel
can still be efficiently linearized by modifying the original hashing procedure
for the GMM kernel. On about 60 publicly available classification datasets, we
verify that the proposed tunable GMM kernels typically improve over the
original GMM kernel. On some datasets, the improvements can be astonishingly
significant.
  For example, on 11 popular datasets which were used for testing deep learning
algorithms and tree methods, our experiments show that the proposed tunable GMM
kernels are strong competitors to trees and deep nets. The previous studies
developed tree methods including ""abc-robust-logitboost"" and demonstrated the
excellent performance on those 11 datasets (and other datasets), by
establishing the second-order tree-split formula and new derivatives for
