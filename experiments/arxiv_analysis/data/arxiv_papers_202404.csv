different datasets to seek assistance from each other to enhance their modeling
performance. We consider a scenario where different learners hold datasets with
potentially distinct variables, and their observations can be aligned by a
nonprivate identifier. Their collaboration faces the following difficulties:
First, learners may need to keep data values or even variable names undisclosed
due to, e.g., commercial interest or privacy regulations; second, there are
restrictions on the number of transmission rounds between them due to e.g.,
communication costs. To address these challenges, we develop a two-stage
assisted learning architecture for an agent, Alice, to seek assistance from
another agent, Bob. In the first stage, we propose a privacy-aware hypothesis
testing-based screening method for Alice to decide on the usefulness of the
data from Bob, in a way that only requires Bob to transmit sketchy data. Once
Alice recognizes Bob's usefulness, Alice and Bob move to the second stage,
where they jointly apply a synergistic iterative model training procedure. With
limited transmissions of summary statistics, we show that Alice can achieve the
oracle performance as if the training were from centralized data, both
theoretically and numerically.","['Jiawei Zhang', 'Yuhong Yang', 'Jie Ding']","['stat.ML', 'cs.LG']",2024-05-13 23:24:25+00:00

analytics, however, mislabeled or noisy data is a common problem in many
domains. Distinguishing low- from high-quality data can be challenging, often
requiring expert knowledge and considerable manual intervention. Data Valuation
algorithms are a class of methods that seek to quantify the value of each
sample in a dataset based on its contribution or importance to a given
predictive task. These data values have shown an impressive ability to identify
mislabeled observations, and filtering low-value data can boost machine
learning performance. In this work, we present a simple alternative to existing
methods, termed Data Valuation with Gradient Similarity (DVGS). This approach
can be easily applied to any gradient descent learning algorithm, scales well
to large datasets, and performs comparably or better than baseline valuation
methods for tasks such as corrupted label discovery and noise quantification.
We evaluate the DVGS method on tabular, image and RNA expression datasets to
show the effectiveness of the method across domains. Our approach has the
ability to rapidly and accurately identify low-quality data, which can reduce
the need for expert knowledge and manual intervention in data cleaning tasks.","['Nathaniel J. Evans', 'Gordon B. Mills', 'Guanming Wu', 'Xubo Song', 'Shannon McWeeney']","['cs.LG', 'q-bio.GN', 'q-bio.QM', 'stat.ML']",2024-05-13 22:10:00+00:00
http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08179v1,Do Bayesian imaging methods report trustworthy probabilities?,"Bayesian statistics is a cornerstone of imaging sciences, underpinning many
and varied approaches from Markov random fields to score-based denoising
diffusion models. In addition to powerful image estimation methods, the
Bayesian paradigm also provides a framework for uncertainty quantification and
for using image data as quantitative evidence. These probabilistic capabilities
are important for the rigorous interpretation of experimental results and for
robust interfacing of quantitative imaging pipelines with scientific and
decision-making processes. However, are the probabilities delivered by existing
Bayesian imaging methods meaningful under replication of an experiment, or are
they only meaningful as subjective measures of belief? This paper presents a
Monte Carlo method to explore this question. We then leverage the proposed
Monte Carlo method and run a large experiment requiring 1,000 GPU-hours to
probe the accuracy of five canonical Bayesian imaging methods that are
representative of some of the main Bayesian imaging strategies from the past
decades (a score-based denoising diffusion technique, a plug-and-play Langevin
algorithm utilising a Lipschitz-regularised DnCNN denoiser, a Bayesian method
with a dictionary-based prior trained subject to a log-concavity constraint, an
empirical Bayesian method with a total-variation prior, and a hierarchical
Bayesian Gibbs sampler based on a Gaussian Markov random field model). We find
that, a few cases, the probabilities reported by modern Bayesian imaging
techniques are in broad agreement with long-term averages as observed over a
large number of replication of an experiment, but existing Bayesian imaging
methods are generally not able to deliver reliable uncertainty quantification
results.","['David Y. W. Thong', 'Charlesquin Kemajou Mbakam', 'Marcelo Pereyra']","['eess.IV', 'cs.LG', 'eess.SP', 'stat.AP', 'stat.ML', '65J22 (Primary), 62F15 (Secondary), 68U10']",2024-05-13 20:57:01+00:00

on causal systems with linear structural equation models (SEMs). The SEMs and
the time-varying pre- and post-interventional statistical models are all
unknown and subject to variations over time. The goal is to design a sequence
of interventions that incur the smallest cumulative regret compared to an

algorithm is proposed, and its cumulative regret is analyzed by establishing
both upper and lower bounds on the regret. It is shown that in a graph with

model deviation $C$, the regret is upper bounded by
$\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(d^{L-\frac{1}{2}}(\sqrt{T} + C))$ and lower bounded by

different RFs. To tackle the essential difficulty, we propose a new
decentralized KRR algorithm that pursues consensus on decision functions, which

expensive-to-evaluate black-box objective functions. An important challenge in
BO is its application to high-dimensional search spaces due in large part to
the curse of dimensionality. One way to overcome this challenge is to focus on
local BO methods that aim to efficiently learn gradients, which have shown
strong empirical performance on a variety of high-dimensional problems
including policy search in reinforcement learning (RL). However, current local
BO methods assume access to only a single high-fidelity information source

Cost-Aware Gradient Entropy Search (CAGES), for local BO of multi-fidelity
black-box functions. CAGES makes no assumption about the relationship between
different information sources, making it more flexible than other
multi-fidelity methods. It also employs a new type of information-theoretic

numerical rewards by performing tasks. Exploration is essential in RL because
agents must discover information before exploiting it. Two rewards encouraging
efficient exploration are the entropy of action policy and curiosity for
information gain. Entropy is well-established in literature, promoting
randomized action selection. Curiosity is defined in a broad variety of ways in
literature, promoting discovery of novel experiences. One example, prediction
error curiosity, rewards agents for discovering observations they cannot
accurately predict. However, such agents may be distracted by unpredictable
observational noises known as curiosity traps. Based on the Free Energy
Principle (FEP), this paper proposes hidden state curiosity, which rewards
agents by the KL divergence between the predictive prior and posterior
probabilities of latent variables. We trained six types of agents to navigate
mazes: baseline agents without rewards for entropy or curiosity, and agents
rewarded for entropy and/or either prediction error curiosity or hidden state
curiosity. We find entropy and curiosity result in efficient exploration,
especially both employed together. Notably, agents with hidden state curiosity
demonstrate resilience against curiosity traps, which hinder agents with
prediction error curiosity. This suggests implementing the FEP may enhance the
robustness and generalization of RL models, potentially aligning the learning
processes of artificial and biological agents.","['Theodore Jerome Tinker', 'Kenji Doya', 'Jun Tani']","['cs.LG', 'stat.ML', '68T01']",2024-05-13 05:18:23+00:00

among the variables of interest. An underlying system may exhibit more
fine-grained causal relationships especially between a variable and its
parents, which will be called the local independence relationships. One of the
most widely studied local relationships is Context-Specific Independence (CSI),
which holds in a specific assignment of conditioned variables. However, its
applicability is often limited since it does not allow continuous variables:
data conditioned to the specific value of a continuous variable contains few
instances, if not none, making it infeasible to test independence. In this
work, we define and characterize the local independence relationship that holds
in a specific set of joint assignments of parental variables, which we call
context-set specific independence (CSSI). We then provide a canonical
representation of CSSI and prove its fundamental properties. Based on our
theoretical findings, we cast the problem of discovering multiple CSSI
relationships in a system as finding a partition of the joint outcome space.
Finally, we propose a novel method, coined neural contextual decomposition

estimand that integrates RCT and RWD and a bias estimand that captures the
conditional effect of RCT enrollment on the outcome. We introduce an adaptive
targeted minimum loss-based estimation (A-TMLE) framework to estimate them. We
prove that the A-TMLE estimator is root-n-consistent and asymptotically normal.
Moreover, in finite sample, it achieves the super-efficiency one would obtain
had one known the oracle model for the conditional effect of the RCT enrollment
on the outcome. Consequently, the smaller the working model of the bias induced
by the RWD is, the greater our estimator's efficiency, while our estimator will
always be at least as efficient as an efficient estimator that uses the RCT
data only. A-TMLE outperforms existing methods in simulations by having smaller
mean-squared-error and 95% confidence intervals. A-TMLE could help utilize RWD
to improve the efficiency of randomized trial results without biasing the

mechanism for maximizing revenue in online auctions by quantifying the
uncertainty in bidders' values without relying on assumptions about value
distributions. COAD incorporates both the bidder and item features and
leverages historical data to provide an incentive-compatible mechanism for
online auctions. Unlike traditional methods for online auctions, COAD employs a
distribution-free, prediction interval-based approach using conformal
prediction techniques. This novel approach ensures that the expected revenue
from our mechanism can achieve at least a constant fraction of the revenue
generated by the optimal mechanism. Additionally, COAD admits the use of a
broad array of modern machine-learning methods, including random forests,
kernel methods, and deep neural nets, for predicting bidders' values. It
ensures revenue performance under any finite sample of historical data.
Moreover, COAD introduces bidder-specific reserve prices based on the lower
confidence bounds of bidders' valuations, which is different from the uniform
reserve prices commonly used in the literature. We validate our theoretical
predictions through extensive simulations and a real-data application. All code
for using COAD and reproducing results is made available on GitHub.","['Jiale Han', 'Xiaowu Dai']","['cs.GT', 'cs.LG', 'stat.ML']",2024-05-11 15:28:25+00:00

of the frequency distribution of a finite number of categories under the local
differential privacy (LDP) framework. The proposed algorithm performs Bayesian
parameter estimation via posterior sampling and adapts the randomization
mechanism for LDP based on the obtained posterior samples. We propose a
randomized mechanism for LDP which uses a subset of categories as an input and
whose performance depends on the selected subset and the true frequency
distribution. By using the posterior sample as an estimate of the frequency
distribution, the algorithm performs a computationally tractable subset
selection step to maximize the utility of the privatized response of the next
user. We propose several utility functions related to well-known information
metrics, such as (but not limited to) Fisher information matrix, total
variation distance, and information entropy. We compare each of these utility
metrics in terms of their computational complexity. We employ stochastic
gradient Langevin dynamics for posterior sampling, a computationally efficient
approximate Markov chain Monte Carlo method. We provide a theoretical analysis
showing that (i) the posterior distribution targeted by the algorithm converges
to the true parameter even for approximate posterior sampling, and (ii) the
algorithm selects the optimal subset with high probability if posterior
sampling is performed exactly. We also provide numerical results that
empirically demonstrate the estimation accuracy of our algorithm where we

like the Black-Scholes (BS) Delta, particularly in the presence of transaction
costs. To assess the real-world applicability of DRL hedging, a second round of
experiments uses a market calibrated stochastic volatility model to train DRL
agents. Specifically, 80 put options across 8 symbols are collected, stochastic
volatility model coefficients are calibrated for each symbol, and a DRL agent
is trained for each of the 80 options by simulating paths of the respective
calibrated model. Not only do DRL agents outperform the BS Delta method when
testing is conducted using the same calibrated stochastic volatility model data
from training, but DRL agents achieves better results when hedging the true
asset path that occurred between the option sale date and the maturity. As
such, not only does this study present the first DRL agents tailored for
American put option hedging, but results on both simulated and empirical market

optimization (DRO), popular for improving a worst group error, and on the
ubiquitous stochastic gradient descent (SGD), due to its inductive bias for
""simpler"" functions. Our empirical results, supported by a theoretical

resource-consumption (packing) constraints. We focus on the generalization of
BwK in which the learner has a set of general long-term constraints. The goal
of the learner is to maximize their cumulative reward, while at the same time
achieving small cumulative constraints violations. In this scenario, there
exist simple instances where conventional methods for BwK fail to yield
sublinear violations of constraints. We show that it is possible to circumvent
this issue by requiring the primal and dual algorithm to be weakly adaptive.
Indeed, even in absence on any information on the Slater's parameter $\rho$
characterizing the problem, the interplay between weakly adaptive primal and
dual regret minimizers yields a ""self-bounding"" property of dual variables. In
particular, their norm remains suitably upper bounded across the entire time
horizon even without explicit projection steps. By exploiting this property, we
provide best-of-both-worlds guarantees for stochastic and adversarial inputs.
In the first case, we show that the algorithm guarantees sublinear regret. In
the latter case, we establish a tight competitive ratio of $\rho/(1+\rho)$. In
both settings, constraints violations are guaranteed to be sublinear in time.
Finally, this results allow us to obtain new result for the problem of

(auxiliary) task to boost the primary task performance which we focus on, while
preserving a single task inference cost of the primary task. While most
existing auxiliary learning methods are optimization-based relying on loss
weights/gradients manipulation, our method is architecture-based with a
flexible asymmetric structure for the primary and auxiliary tasks, which
produces different networks for training and inference. Specifically, starting
from two single task networks/branches (each representing a task), we propose a
novel method with evolving networks where only primary-to-auxiliary links exist
as the cross-task connections after convergence. These connections can be
removed during the primary task inference, resulting in a single-task inference
cost. We achieve this by formulating a Neural Architecture Search (NAS)
problem, where we initialize bi-directional connections in the search space and
guide the NAS optimization converging to an architecture with only the
single-side primary-to-auxiliary connections. Moreover, our method can be
incorporated with optimization-based auxiliary learning approaches. Extensive
experiments with six tasks on NYU v2, CityScapes, and Taskonomy datasets using
VGG, ResNet, and ViT backbones validate the promising performance. The codes

problems are the framework of choice in applications that are risk averse.
These benefits come at the cost of computations that are in general,
intractable. New advances in machine learning and variational inference (VI)
have lowered the computational barrier by learning from examples. Two VI
paradigms have emerged that represent different tradeoffs: amortized and
non-amortized. Amortized VI can produce fast results but due to generalizing to
many observed datasets it produces suboptimal inference results. Non-amortized
VI is slower at inference but finds better posterior approximations since it is
specialized towards a single observed dataset. Current amortized VI techniques
run into a sub-optimality wall that can not be improved without more expressive
neural networks or extra training data. We present a solution that enables
iterative improvement of amortized posteriors that uses the same networks

offline thus our method maintains cheap and reusable online evaluation while
bridging the approximation gap these two paradigms. We denote our proposed

principle the bias can be rectified by subtracting the appropriate information
cost, leading to the modified measure known as the reduced mutual information,

cost, and the value of the reduced mutual information depends crucially on how
good a bound is established. In this paper we describe an improved method for

approximately correct (PAC) learners. The closely related transductive model of
learning has recently seen more scrutiny, with its learners often used as
precursors to PAC learners. Our goal in this work is to understand and quantify
the exact relationship between these two models. First, we observe that modest
extensions of existing results show the models to be essentially equivalent for
realizable learning for most natural loss functions, up to low order terms in
the error and sample complexity. The situation for agnostic learning appears
less straightforward, with sample complexities potentially separated by a
$\frac{1}{\epsilon}$ factor. This is therefore where our main contributions
lie. Our results are two-fold:
  1. For agnostic learning with bounded losses (including, for example,
multiclass classification), we show that PAC learning reduces to transductive
learning at the cost of low-order terms in the error and sample complexity via
an adaptation of the reduction of arXiv:2304.09167 to the agnostic setting.
  2. For agnostic binary classification, we show the converse: transductive
learning is essentially no more difficult than PAC learning. Together with our
first result this implies that the PAC and transductive models are essentially
equivalent for agnostic binary classification. This is our most technical
result, and involves two steps: A symmetrization argument on the agnostic
one-inclusion graph (OIG) of arXiv:2309.13692 to derive the worst-case agnostic
transductive instance, and expressing the error of the agnostic OIG algorithm
for this instance in terms of the empirical Rademacher complexity of the class.

extended beyond binary classification to show the transductive and PAC models
equivalent more broadly.","['Shaddin Dughmi', 'Yusuf Kalayci', 'Grayson York']","['stat.ML', 'cs.DS', 'cs.LG', 'math.ST', 'stat.TH']",2024-05-08 16:26:49+00:00

Despite its impressive empirical success and increasing popularity, its
wide-scale adoption remains limited due to the high computational cost of

gradient of the posterior cannot be computed (for example, with black-box
simulators). To overcome these challenges, we propose a novel two-stage

discovery, treatment intervention, and transfer learning. This paper introduces
a novel algorithmic method for addressing nonparametric invariance and
causality learning in regression models across multiple environments, where the
joint distribution of response variables and covariates varies, but the
conditional expectations of outcome given an unknown set of quasi-causal
variables are invariant. The challenge of finding such an unknown set of
quasi-causal or invariant variables is compounded by the presence of endogenous
variables that have heterogeneous effects across different environments,
including even one of them in the regression would make the estimation
inconsistent. The proposed Focused Adversial Invariant Regularization (FAIR)
framework utilizes an innovative minimax optimization approach that breaks down
the barriers, driving regression models toward prediction-invariant solutions
through adversarial testing. Leveraging the representation power of neural
networks, FAIR neural networks (FAIR-NN) are introduced for causality pursuit.
It is shown that FAIR-NN can find the invariant variables and quasi-causal
variables under a minimal identification condition and that the resulting
procedure is adaptive to low-dimensional composition structures in a
non-asymptotic analysis. Under a structural causal model, variables identified
by FAIR-NN represent pragmatic causality and provably align with exact causal
mechanisms under conditions of sufficient heterogeneity. Computationally,
FAIR-NN employs a novel Gumbel approximation with decreased temperature and
stochastic gradient descent ascent algorithm. The procedures are convincingly
demonstrated using simulated and real-data examples.","['Yihong Gu', 'Cong Fang', 'Peter B√ºhlmann', 'Jianqing Fan']","['math.ST', 'cs.LG', 'stat.ME', 'stat.ML', 'stat.TH', '62G08']",2024-05-07 23:37:40+00:00

learning model and returns a set of plausible labels that contain the true
label with a prescribed coverage rate. In practice, the empirical coverage
achieved highly relies on fully observed label information from data both in
the training phase for model fitting and the calibration phase for quantile
estimation. This dependency poses a challenge in the context of online learning
with bandit feedback, where a learner only has access to the correctness of
actions (i.e., pulled an arm) but not the full information of the true label.
In particular, when the pulled arm is incorrect, the learner only knows that
the pulled one is not the true class label, but does not know which label is
true. Additionally, bandit feedback further results in a smaller labeled
dataset for calibration, limited to instances with correct actions, thereby
affecting the accuracy of quantile estimation. To address these limitations, we
propose Bandit Class-specific Conformal Prediction (BCCP), offering coverage
guarantees on a class-specific granularity. Using an unbiased estimation of an

Similarly, sampling discrepancy can cause the empirical $2$-Wasserstein

rate of $n^{-1/4}$, which is significantly slower than the rate of $n^{-1/2}$
for $1$-Wasserstein distance. We introduce a new family of distances
parameterized by $k \ge 0$, called $k$-RPW that is based on computing the

demonstrations of how BFCR trend lines may be used effectively for anomaly
detection both within and at the edges of arbitrary one-dimensional data sets.
Finally, potential issues which may arise while using BFCR for anomaly
detection as well as possible mitigation techniques are outlined and discussed.

http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03723v1,Generative adversarial learning with optimal input dimension and its adaptive generator architecture,"We investigate the impact of the input dimension on the generalization error
in generative adversarial networks (GANs). In particular, we first provide both
theoretical and practical evidence to validate the existence of an optimal
input dimension (OID) that minimizes the generalization error. Then, to
identify the OID, we introduce a novel framework called generalized GANs
(G-GANs), which includes existing GANs as a special case. By incorporating the
group penalty and the architecture penalty developed in the paper, G-GANs have
several intriguing features. First, our framework offers adaptive
dimensionality reduction from the initial dimension to a dimension necessary
for generating the target distribution. Second, this reduction in
dimensionality also shrinks the required size of the generator network
architecture, which is automatically identified by the proposed architecture
penalty. Both reductions in dimensionality and the generator network
significantly improve the stability and the accuracy of the estimation and
prediction. Theoretical support for the consistent selection of the input
dimension and the generator network is provided. Third, the proposed algorithm
involves an end-to-end training process, and the algorithm allows for dynamic
adjustments between the input dimension and the generator network during
training, further enhancing the overall performance of G-GANs. Extensive
experiments conducted with simulated and benchmark data demonstrate the
superior performance of G-GANs. In particular, compared to that of
off-the-shelf methods, G-GANs achieves an average improvement of 45.68% in the
CT slice dataset, 43.22% in the MNIST dataset and 46.94% in the FashionMNIST
dataset in terms of the maximum mean discrepancy or Frechet inception distance.
Moreover, the features generated based on the input dimensions identified by
G-GANs align with visually significant features.","['Zhiyao Tan', 'Ling Zhou', 'Huazhen Lin']","['cs.LG', 'stat.ME', 'stat.ML']",2024-05-06 03:30:02+00:00
http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03130v1,Deep Learning for Causal Inference: A Comparison of Architectures for Heterogeneous Treatment Effect Estimation,"Causal inference has gained much popularity in recent years, with interests
ranging from academic, to industrial, to educational, and all in between.
Concurrently, the study and usage of neural networks has also grown profoundly
(albeit at a far faster rate). What we aim to do in this blog write-up is
demonstrate a Neural Network causal inference architecture. We develop a fully
connected neural network implementation of the popular Bayesian Causal Forest
algorithm, a state of the art tree based method for estimating heterogeneous
treatment effects. We compare our implementation to existing neural network
causal inference methodologies, showing improvements in performance in
simulation settings. We apply our method to a dataset examining the effect of
stress on sleep.","['Demetrios Papakostas', 'Andrew Herren', 'P. Richard Hahn', 'Francisco Castillo']","['stat.ML', 'cs.LG']",2024-05-06 02:54:53+00:00
http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03083v2,Causal K-Means Clustering,"Causal effects are often characterized with population summaries. These might
provide an incomplete picture when there are heterogeneous treatment effects
across subgroups. Since the subgroup structure is typically unknown, it is more
challenging to identify and evaluate subgroup effects than population effects.
We propose a new solution to this problem: Causal k-Means Clustering, which
harnesses the widely-used k-means clustering algorithm to uncover the unknown
subgroup structure. Our problem differs significantly from the conventional
clustering setup since the variables to be clustered are unknown counterfactual
functions. We present a plug-in estimator which is simple and readily
implementable using off-the-shelf algorithms, and study its rate of
convergence. We also develop a new bias-corrected estimator based on
nonparametric efficiency theory and double machine learning, and show that this
estimator achieves fast root-n rates and asymptotic normality in large
nonparametric models. Our proposed methods are especially useful for modern
outcome-wide studies with multiple treatment levels. Further, our framework is
extensible to clustering with generic pseudo-outcomes, such as partially
observed outcomes or otherwise unknown functions. Finally, we explore finite
sample properties via simulation, and illustrate the proposed methods in a
study of treatment programs for adolescent substance abuse.","['Kwangho Kim', 'Jisu Kim', 'Edward H. Kennedy']","['stat.ME', 'cs.LG', 'stat.ML']",2024-05-05 23:59:51+00:00
