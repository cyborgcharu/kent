with general and varying distributions in a scalable framework, where fully
parallelizable operations should be preferred. The new paradigm is inspired by
the context of discrete choice models. Compared to classical algorithms, we add
parallelized randomness, and we leave the final simulation of the random
variable to a single associative operation. We characterize the set of
algorithms that work in this way, and those algorithms that may have an
additive or multiplicative local noise. As a consequence, we could define a
natural way to solve some popular simulation problems.",['Giacomo Aletti'],"['stat.ME', 'math.ST', 'stat.ML', 'stat.TH', '62D05 (Primary) 65C10, 68A55 (Secondary)']",2016-11-21 23:37:31+00:00

itself is not well defined: it remains unclear what interpretability means

spaces, such as combinatorial and polyhedral sets, that is based on minimizing
estimated conditional risk functions. Given a loss function defined over pairs
of output labels, we first estimate the conditional risk function by solving a
(possibly infinite) collection of regularized least squares problems. A
prediction is made by solving an inference problem that minimizes the estimated
conditional risk function over the output space. We show that this approach
enables, in some cases, efficient training and inference without explicitly
introducing a convex surrogate for the original loss function, even when it is
discontinuous. Empirical evaluations on real-world and synthetic data sets

topics in Statistical Learning Theory and Machine Learning (ML). In ML
literature, attempts have been made to enhance prediction through precise
feature selection methods. In sparse linear models, LASSO is well-known in
extracting the desired support of the signal and resisting against noisy
systems. When sparse models are also suffering from MI, the sparse recovery and
inference of the missing models are taken into account simultaneously. In this
paper, we will introduce an approach which enjoys sparse regression and
covariance matrix estimation to improve matrix completion accuracy, and as a
result enhancing feature selection preciseness which leads to reduction in
prediction Mean Squared Error (MSE). We will compare the effect of employing
covariance matrix in enhancing estimation accuracy to the case it is not used
in feature selection. Simulations show the improvement in the performance as
compared to the case where the covariance matrix estimation is not used.","['Ahmadreza Moradipari', 'Sina Shahsavari', 'Ashkan Esmaeili', 'Farokh Marvasti']","['stat.ML', 'stat.ME']",2016-11-21 23:07:51+00:00

behaviour policies in environments that are initially unknown. State-of-the-art
reinforcement learning approaches, such as deep Q-networks, are model-free and
learn to act effectively across a wide range of environments such as Atari
games, but require huge amounts of data. Model-based techniques are more
data-efficient, but need to acquire explicit knowledge about the environment.
  In this paper, we take a step towards using model-based techniques in
environments with a high-dimensional visual state space by demonstrating that
it is possible to learn system dynamics and the reward structure jointly. Our
contribution is to extend a recently developed deep neural network for video
frame prediction in Atari games to enable reward prediction as well. To this
end, we phrase a joint optimization problem for minimizing both video frame and
reward reconstruction loss, and adapt network parameters accordingly. Empirical
evaluations on five Atari games demonstrate accurate cumulative reward
prediction of up to 200 frames. We consider these results as opening up
important directions for model-based reinforcement learning in complex,

sampling is a well-known Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm, extensively
used in signal processing, machine learning, and statistics, employed to draw
samples from complicated high-dimensional posterior distributions. The key
point for the successful application of the Gibbs sampler is the ability to
draw efficiently samples from the full-conditional probability density
functions. Since in the general case this is not possible, in order to speed up
the convergence of the chain, it is required to generate auxiliary samples
whose information is eventually disregarded. In this work, we show that these
auxiliary samples can be recycled within the Gibbs estimators, improving their
efficiency with no extra cost. This novel scheme arises naturally after
pointing out the relationship between the standard Gibbs sampler and the chain
rule used for sampling purposes. Numerical simulations involving simple and
real inference problems confirm the excellent performance of the proposed
scheme in terms of accuracy and computational efficiency. In particular we give
empirical evidence of performance in a toy example, inference of Gaussian

time series data. Recently introduced techniques such as Automatic Bayesian
Covariance Discovery (ABCD) provide a way to find structure within a single
time series by searching through a space of covariance kernels that is
generated using a simple grammar. While ABCD can identify a broad class of
temporal patterns, it is difficult to extend and can be brittle in practice.
This paper shows how to extend ABCD by formulating it in terms of probabilistic
program synthesis. The key technical ideas are to (i) represent models using
abstract syntax trees for a domain-specific probabilistic language, and (ii)
represent the time series model prior, likelihood, and search strategy using
probabilistic programs in a sufficiently expressive language. The final
probabilistic program is written in under 70 lines of probabilistic code in

in healthcare, but two important challenges remain: -Data insufficiency:Often
in healthcare predictive modeling, the sample size is insufficient for deep
learning methods to achieve satisfactory results. -Interpretation:The
representations learned by deep learning methods should align with medical
knowledge. To address these challenges, we propose a GRaph-based Attention
Model, GRAM that supplements electronic health records (EHR) with hierarchical
information inherent to medical ontologies. Based on the data volume and the
ontology structure, GRAM represents a medical concept as a combination of its
ancestors in the ontology via an attention mechanism. We compared predictive
performance (i.e. accuracy, data needs, interpretability) of GRAM to various
methods including the recurrent neural network (RNN) in two sequential
diagnoses prediction tasks and one heart failure prediction task. Compared to
the basic RNN, GRAM achieved 10% higher accuracy for predicting diseases rarely
observed in the training data and 3% improved area under the ROC curve for
predicting heart failure using an order of magnitude less training data.
Additionally, unlike other methods, the medical concept representations learned
by GRAM are well aligned with the medical ontology. Finally, GRAM exhibits
intuitive attention behaviors by adaptively generalizing to higher level

One key assumption behind lexicon-based classification is that all words in
each lexicon are equally predictive. This is rarely true in practice, which is
why lexicon-based approaches are usually outperformed by supervised classifiers
that learn distinct weights on each word from labeled instances. This paper
shows that it is possible to learn such weights without labeled data, by

fields including personalized ad recommendation in online marketing. We
formulate a notion of safety for this class of algorithms. We develop a safe
contextual linear bandit algorithm, called conservative linear UCB (CLUCB),
that simultaneously minimizes its regret and satisfies the safety constraint,
i.e., maintains its performance above a fixed percentage of the performance of
a baseline strategy, uniformly over time. We prove an upper-bound on the regret
of CLUCB and show that it can be decomposed into two terms: 1) an upper-bound
for the regret of the standard linear UCB algorithm that grows with the time
horizon and 2) a constant (does not grow with the time horizon) term that
accounts for the loss of being conservative in order to satisfy the safety
constraint. We empirically show that our algorithm is safe and validate our
theoretical analysis.","['Abbas Kazerouni', 'Mohammad Ghavamzadeh', 'Yasin Abbasi-Yadkori', 'Benjamin Van Roy']","['stat.ML', 'cs.LG']",2016-11-19 20:36:30+00:00

information from individuals across the world, it has also proved to be a place

In this article, we aim to support the task of making sense from social media
data, and specifically, seek to build an autonomous message-classifier that
filters relevant and trustworthy information from Twitter. For our work, we
collected about 100 million public tweets, including users' past tweets, from
which we identified 72 rumours (41 true, 31 false). We considered over 80
trustworthiness measures including the authors' profile and past behaviour, the
social network connections (graphs), and the content of tweets themselves. We
ran modern machine-learning classifiers over those measures to produce
trustworthiness scores at various time windows from the outbreak of the rumour.
Such time-windows were key as they allowed useful insight into the progression
of the rumours. From our findings, we identified that our model was
significantly more accurate than similar studies in the literature. We also
identified critical attributes of the data that give rise to the
trustworthiness scores assigned. Finally we developed a software demonstration

why do they not seem to be affected by bad local minima? It is widely believed
that training of deep models using gradient methods works so well because the
error surface either has no local minima, or if they exist they need to be
close in value to the global minimum. It is known that such results hold under
very strong assumptions which are not satisfied by real models. In this paper
we present examples showing that for such theorem to be true additional
assumptions on the data, initialization schemes and/or the model classes have
to be made. We look at the particular case of finite size datasets. We

wide range of customers who have no experience and resources to tune DL
hyper-parameters, and meticulous tuning for each user's dataset is
prohibitively expensive. Therefore, TaaS hyper-parameters must be fixed with
values that are applicable to all users. IBM Watson Natural Language Classifier

enterprise-level clients around the globe, is a typical TaaS service. By
evaluating the NLC workloads, we show that only the conservative
hyper-parameter setup (e.g., small mini-batch size and small learning rate) can
guarantee acceptable model accuracy for a wide range of customers. We further
justify theoretically why such a setup guarantees better model convergence in
general. Unfortunately, the small mini-batch size causes a high volume of
communication traffic in a parameter-server based system. We characterize the
high communication bandwidth requirement of TaaS using representative
industrial deep learning workloads and demonstrate that none of the

complex regularities in data. Gaussian processes are successfully used for
classification/regression problems and dimensionality reduction. In this work
we consider the classification problem only. The complexity of standard methods
for GP-classification scales cubically with the size of the training dataset.
This complexity makes them inapplicable to big data problems. Therefore, a
variety of methods were introduced to overcome this limitation. In the paper we
focus on methods based on so called inducing inputs. This approach is based on
variational inference and proposes a particular lower bound for marginal
likelihood (evidence). This bound is then maximized w.r.t. parameters of kernel
function of the Gaussian process, thus fitting the model to data. The
computational complexity of this method is $O(nm^2)$, where $m$ is the number
of inducing inputs used by the model and is assumed to be substantially smaller
than the size of the dataset $n$. Recently, a new evidence lower bound for
GP-classification problem was introduced. It allows using stochastic
optimization, which makes it suitable for big data problems. However, the new
lower bound depends on $O(m^2)$ variational parameter, which makes optimization
challenging in case of big m. In this work we develop a new approach for
training inducing input GP models for classification problems. Here we use
quadratic approximation of several terms in the aforementioned evidence lower
bound, obtaining analytical expressions for optimal values of most of the
parameters in the optimization, thus sufficiently reducing the dimension of
optimization space. In our experiments we achieve as well or better results,

such an effort to advance the state of the art of sparse spectrum GP models to
achieve competitive predictive performance for massive datasets. Our
generalized framework of stochastic variational Bayesian sparse spectrum GP

of the spectral frequencies to avoid overfitting, modeling these frequencies
jointly in its variational distribution to enable their interaction a
posteriori, and exploiting local data for boosting the predictive performance.
However, such structural improvements result in a variational lower bound that
is intractable to be optimized. To resolve this, we exploit a variational
parameterization trick to make it amenable to stochastic optimization.
Interestingly, the resulting stochastic gradient has a linearly decomposable
structure that can be exploited to refine our stochastic optimization method to
incur constant time per iteration while preserving its property of being an
unbiased estimator of the exact gradient of the variational lower bound.

application to the Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange (ABIDE) database, a large

unique node providing the maximum expected reward, along which the expected
reward is monotonically increasing. Previous results on this setting describe
the behavior of frequentist MAB algorithms. In our paper, we design a Thompson
Sampling-based algorithm whose asymptotic pseudo-regret matches the lower bound

interpretable.However, they can be prone to overfitting, which results in a low
predictive performance. Ensemble techniques are able to achieve a higher

where decision support, instead of decision making, is crucial.
  To bridge this gap, we present the GENESIM algorithm that transforms an
ensemble of decision trees to a single decision tree with an enhanced
predictive performance by using a genetic algorithm. We compared GENESIM to
prevalent decision tree induction and ensemble techniques using twelve publicly
available data sets. The results show that GENESIM achieves a better predictive
performance on most of these data sets than decision tree induction techniques
and a predictive performance in the same order of magnitude as the ensemble

posterior in part because it formulates posterior approximation as an
optimization problem: to find the closest distribution to the exact posterior
over some family of distributions. For practical reasons, the family of
distributions in VI is usually constrained so that it does not include the
exact posterior, even as a limit point. Thus, no matter how long VI is run, the
resulting approximation will not approach the exact posterior. We propose to
instead consider a more flexible approximating family consisting of all
possible finite mixtures of a parametric base distribution (e.g., Gaussian).
For efficient inference, we borrow ideas from gradient boosting to develop an
algorithm we call boosting variational inference (BVI). BVI iteratively
improves the current approximation by mixing it with a new component from the
base distribution family and thereby yields progressively more accurate
posterior approximations as more computing time is spent. Unlike a number of
common VI variants including mean-field VI, BVI is able to capture
multimodality, general posterior covariance, and nonstandard posterior shapes.","['Fangjian Guo', 'Xiangyu Wang', 'Kai Fan', 'Tamara Broderick', 'David B. Dunson']","['stat.ML', 'cs.LG']",2016-11-17 04:19:16+00:00

the process finds quantifications for the categories that are optimal for the
regression model in the sense that they maximize the multiple correlation.
Although the optimal scaling method was developed initially for variables with
a limited number of categories, optimal transformations of continuous variables
are a special case. We will consider a variety of transformation types;
typically we use step functions for categorical variables, and smooth (spline)
functions for continuous variables. Both types of functions can be restricted
to be monotonic, preserving the ordinal information in the data. In addition to
optimal scaling, three regularization methods will be considered: Ridge
regression, the Lasso, and the Elastic Net. The resulting method will be called
ROS Regression (Regularized Optimal Scaling Regression. We will show that the
basic OS algorithm provides straightforward and efficient estimation of the
regularized regression coefficients, automatically gives the Group Lasso and
Blockwise Sparse Regression, and extends them with monotonicity properties. We
will show that Optimal Scaling linearizes nonlinear relationships between
predictors and outcome, and improves upon the condition of the predictor
correlation matrix, increasing (on average) the conditional independence of the
predictors. Alternative options for regularization of either regression
coefficients or category quantifications are mentioned. Extended examples are

precision, both from a theoretical and practical perspective, and ask: is it
possible to train models at end-to-end low precision with provable guarantees?
Can this lead to consistent order-of-magnitude speedups? We present a framework

We develop a simple framework based on one simple but novel strategy called
double sampling. Our framework is able to execute training at low precision
with no bias, guaranteeing convergence, whereas naive quantization would
introduce significant bias. We validate our framework across a range of
applications, and show that it enables an FPGA prototype that is up to 6.5x
faster than an implementation using full 32-bit precision. We further develop a
variance-optimal stochastic quantization strategy and show that it can make a
significant difference in a variety of settings. When applied to linear models
together with double sampling, we save up to another 1.7x in data movement
compared with uniform quantization. When training deep networks with quantized
models, we achieve higher accuracy than the state-of-the-art XNOR-Net. Finally,
we extend our framework through approximation to non-linear models, such as

by solving a convex optimization program. This program seeks a sparse set of
weights at each layer that keeps the layer inputs and outputs consistent with
the originally trained model. The algorithms and associated analysis are

noise matrix with independent subgaussian column vectors, independent of $X_0$

the literature in the sense that we allow the measurement error for each
covariate to be a dependent vector across its $n$ observations. Such error
structures appear in the science literature when modeling the trial-to-trial
fluctuations in response strength shared across a set of neurons.
  Under sparsity and restrictive eigenvalue type of conditions, we show that

establish consistency in estimating $\beta^*$ and obtain the rates of
convergence in the $\ell_q$ norm, where $q = 1, 2$. We show error bounds which
approach that of the regular Lasso and the Dantzig selector in case the errors

neighborhood of the global minimizers: the size of the neighborhood is bounded
by the statistical error in the $\ell_2$ norm. Our analysis reveals interesting

invariant under any strictly monotone transformation of the individual
predictor variables. However, this statement may be false when predicting new
observations with values that were not seen in the training-set and are close
to the location of the split point of a tree rule. The sensitivity of the
prediction error to the split point interpolation is high when the split point
of the tree is estimated based on very few observations, reaching 9%
misclassification error when only 10 observations are used for constructing a
split, and shrinking to 1% when relying on 100 observations. This study
compares the performance of alternative methods for split point interpolation
and concludes that the best choice is taking the mid-point between the two
closest points to the split point of the tree. Furthermore, if the (continuous)
distribution of the predictor variable is known, then using its probability
integral for transforming the variable (""quantile transformation"") will reduce
the model's interpolation error by up to about a half on average. Accordingly,
this study provides guidelines for both developers and users of decision tree

known to offer computational advantages over simulated annealing. Here we
report on the ability of recent QA hardware to accelerate training of fully

hardware, and show that in many cases, the quantum distributions differ
significantly from classical Boltzmann distributions. In spite of this
difference, training (which seeks to match data and model statistics) using
standard classical gradient updates is still effective. We investigate the use
of QA for seeding Markov chains as an alternative to contrastive divergence

show that for problems with high-energy barriers between modes, QA-based seeds
can improve upon chains with CD and PCD initializations. For these hard
problems, QA gradient estimates are more accurate, and allow for faster
learning. Furthermore, and interestingly, even the case of raw QA samples (that
is, $k=0$) achieved similar improvements. We argue that this relates to the
fact that we are training a quantum rather than classical Boltzmann

Instead, we propose an estimator that directly fits the underlying preference

proposed estimator makes no generative assumption on the numerical scores of
the observations. One consequence is that the proposed estimator can fit any

acyclic graph (DAG), generalizing standard techniques that can only fit
preference scores. Despite this generality, for supervision representing total

use past outcome probabilities as features in the present. Use of such past

information to be taken into account when making initial probability estimates
and subsequently performing inverse classification. Secondly, following inverse
classification application, optimized instances' unchangeable features
(e.g.,~age) are updated using values from the next longitudinal time period.
Optimized test instance probabilities are then reassessed. Updating the
unchangeable features in this manner reflects the notion that improvements in
outcome likelihood, which result from following the inverse classification
recommendations, do not materialize instantaneously. As our experiments
