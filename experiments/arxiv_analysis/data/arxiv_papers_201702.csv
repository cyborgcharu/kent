http://arxiv.org/abs/1703.07370v4,"REBAR: Low-variance, unbiased gradient estimates for discrete latent variable models","Learning in models with discrete latent variables is challenging due to high
variance gradient estimators. Generally, approaches have relied on control
variates to reduce the variance of the REINFORCE estimator. Recent work (Jang
et al. 2016, Maddison et al. 2016) has taken a different approach, introducing
a continuous relaxation of discrete variables to produce low-variance, but
biased, gradient estimates. In this work, we combine the two approaches through
a novel control variate that produces low-variance, \emph{unbiased} gradient
estimates. Then, we introduce a modification to the continuous relaxation and
show that the tightness of the relaxation can be adapted online, removing it as
a hyperparameter. We show state-of-the-art variance reduction on several
benchmark generative modeling tasks, generally leading to faster convergence to
a better final log-likelihood.","['George Tucker', 'Andriy Mnih', 'Chris J. Maddison', 'Dieterich Lawson', 'Jascha Sohl-Dickstein']","['cs.LG', 'stat.ML']",2017-03-21 18:05:31+00:00
http://arxiv.org/abs/1703.07355v1,An Army of Me: Sockpuppets in Online Discussion Communities,"In online discussion communities, users can interact and share information
and opinions on a wide variety of topics. However, some users may create
multiple identities, or sockpuppets, and engage in undesired behavior by
deceiving others or manipulating discussions. In this work, we study
sockpuppetry across nine discussion communities, and show that sockpuppets
differ from ordinary users in terms of their posting behavior, linguistic
traits, as well as social network structure. Sockpuppets tend to start fewer
discussions, write shorter posts, use more personal pronouns such as ""I"", and
have more clustered ego-networks. Further, pairs of sockpuppets controlled by
the same individual are more likely to interact on the same discussion at the
same time than pairs of ordinary users. Our analysis suggests a taxonomy of
deceptive behavior in discussion communities. Pairs of sockpuppets can vary in
their deceptiveness, i.e., whether they pretend to be different users, or their
supportiveness, i.e., if they support arguments of other sockpuppets controlled
by the same user. We apply these findings to a series of prediction tasks,
notably, to identify whether a pair of accounts belongs to the same underlying
user or not. Altogether, this work presents a data-driven view of deception in
online discussion communities and paves the way towards the automatic detection
of sockpuppets.","['Srijan Kumar', 'Justin Cheng', 'Jure Leskovec', 'V. S. Subrahmanian']","['cs.SI', 'cs.CY', 'physics.soc-ph', 'stat.AP', 'stat.ML']",2017-03-21 18:00:02+00:00

structure in many domains, for example, sparse learning, feature selection, and
compressed sensing. To solve a cardinality constrained problem, the key
challenge is to solve the projection onto the cardinality constraint set, which
is NP-hard in general when there exist multiple overlapped cardinality
constraints. In this paper, we consider the scenario where the overlapped
cardinality constraints satisfy a Three-view Cardinality Structure (TVCS),
which reflects the natural restriction in many applications, such as
identification of gene regulatory networks and task-worker assignment problem.
We cast the projection into a linear programming, and show that for TVCS, the
vertex solution of this linear programming is the solution for the original
projection problem. We further prove that such solution can be found with the
complexity proportional to the number of variables and constraints. We finally
use synthetic experiments and two interesting applications in bioinformatics
and crowdsourcing to validate the proposed TVCS model and method.","['Haichuan Yang', 'Shupeng Gui', 'Chuyang Ke', 'Daniel Stefankovic', 'Ryohei Fujimaki', 'Ji Liu']","['cs.LG', 'stat.ML']",2017-03-21 17:58:03+00:00
http://arxiv.org/abs/1703.07305v1,Targeting Bayes factors with direct-path non-equilibrium thermodynamic integration,"Thermodynamic integration (TI) for computing marginal likelihoods is based on
an inverse annealing path from the prior to the posterior distribution. In many
cases, the resulting estimator suffers from high variability, which
particularly stems from the prior regime. When comparing complex models with
differences in a comparatively small number of parameters, intrinsic errors
from sampling fluctuations may outweigh the differences in the log marginal
likelihood estimates. In the present article, we propose a thermodynamic
integration scheme that directly targets the log Bayes factor. The method is
based on a modified annealing path between the posterior distributions of the
two models compared, which systematically avoids the high variance prior
regime. We combine this scheme with the concept of non-equilibrium TI to
minimise discretisation errors from numerical integration. Results obtained on
Bayesian regression models applied to standard benchmark data, and a complex
hierarchical model applied to biopathway inference, demonstrate a significant
reduction in estimator variance over state-of-the-art TI methods.","['Marco Grzegorczyk', 'Andrej Aderhold', 'Dirk Husmeier']","['stat.ME', 'stat.ML']",2017-03-21 16:39:28+00:00

synapses, between neurons. This poses a problem as the primary computational
bottleneck for neural networks is the vector-matrix multiply when inputs are
multiplied by the neural network weights. Conventional processing architectures
are not well suited for simulating neural networks, often requiring large
amounts of energy and time. Additionally, synapses in biological neural
networks are not binary connections, but exhibit a nonlinear response function
as neurotransmitters are emitted and diffuse between neurons. Inspired by
neuroscience principles, we present a digital neuromorphic architecture, the
Spiking Temporal Processing Unit (STPU), capable of modeling arbitrary complex
synaptic response functions without requiring additional hardware components.
We consider the paradigm of spiking neurons with temporally coded information
as opposed to non-spiking rate coded neurons used in most neural networks. In
this paradigm we examine liquid state machines applied to speech recognition
and show how a liquid state machine with temporal dynamics maps onto the
STPU-demonstrating the flexibility and efficiency of the STPU for instantiating
neural algorithms.","['Michael R. Smith', 'Aaron J. Hill', 'Kristofor D. Carlson', 'Craig M. Vineyard', 'Jonathon Donaldson', 'David R. Follett', 'Pamela L. Follett', 'John H. Naegle', 'Conrad D. James', 'James B. Aimone']","['q-bio.NC', 'cs.NE', 'stat.ML']",2017-03-21 16:12:31+00:00
http://arxiv.org/abs/1703.07285v2,From safe screening rules to working sets for faster Lasso-type solvers,"Convex sparsity-promoting regularizations are ubiquitous in modern
statistical learning. By construction, they yield solutions with few non-zero
coefficients, which correspond to saturated constraints in the dual
optimization formulation. Working set (WS) strategies are generic optimization
techniques that consist in solving simpler problems that only consider a subset
of constraints, whose indices form the WS. Working set methods therefore
involve two nested iterations: the outer loop corresponds to the definition of
the WS and the inner loop calls a solver for the subproblems. For the Lasso
estimator a WS is a set of features, while for a Group Lasso it refers to a set
of groups. In practice, WS are generally small in this context so the
associated feature Gram matrix can fit in memory. Here we show that the
Gauss-Southwell rule (a greedy strategy for block coordinate descent
techniques) leads to fast solvers in this case. Combined with a working set
strategy based on an aggressive use of so-called Gap Safe screening rules, we
propose a solver achieving state-of-the-art performance on sparse learning
problems. Results are presented on Lasso and multi-task Lasso estimators.","['Mathurin Massias', 'Alexandre Gramfort', 'Joseph Salmon']","['stat.ML', 'cs.LG', 'math.OC', 'stat.CO']",2017-03-21 15:42:38+00:00
http://arxiv.org/abs/1703.07255v2,ZM-Net: Real-time Zero-shot Image Manipulation Network,"Many problems in image processing and computer vision (e.g. colorization,
style transfer) can be posed as 'manipulating' an input image into a
corresponding output image given a user-specified guiding signal. A holy-grail
solution towards generic image manipulation should be able to efficiently alter
an input image with any personalized signals (even signals unseen during
training), such as diverse paintings and arbitrary descriptive attributes.
However, existing methods are either inefficient to simultaneously process
multiple signals (let alone generalize to unseen signals), or unable to handle
signals from other modalities. In this paper, we make the first attempt to
address the zero-shot image manipulation task. We cast this problem as
manipulating an input image according to a parametric model whose key
parameters can be conditionally generated from any guiding signal (even unseen
ones). To this end, we propose the Zero-shot Manipulation Net (ZM-Net), a
fully-differentiable architecture that jointly optimizes an
image-transformation network (TNet) and a parameter network (PNet). The PNet
learns to generate key transformation parameters for the TNet given any guiding
signal while the TNet performs fast zero-shot image manipulation according to
both signal-dependent parameters from the PNet and signal-invariant parameters
from the TNet itself. Extensive experiments show that our ZM-Net can perform
high-quality image manipulation conditioned on different forms of guiding
signals (e.g. style images and attributes) in real-time (tens of milliseconds
per image) even for unseen signals. Moreover, a large-scale style dataset with
over 20,000 style images is also constructed to promote further research.","['Hao Wang', 'Xiaodan Liang', 'Hao Zhang', 'Dit-Yan Yeung', 'Eric P. Xing']","['cs.CV', 'cs.AI', 'cs.GR', 'cs.LG', 'stat.ML']",2017-03-21 15:01:59+00:00
http://arxiv.org/abs/1703.07198v1,Overcoming model simplifications when quantifying predictive uncertainty,"It is generally accepted that all models are wrong -- the difficulty is
determining which are useful. Here, a useful model is considered as one that is
capable of combining data and expert knowledge, through an inversion or
calibration process, to adequately characterize the uncertainty in predictions
of interest. This paper derives conditions that specify which simplified models
are useful and how they should be calibrated. To start, the notion of an
optimal simplification is defined. This relates the model simplifications to
the nature of the data and predictions, and determines when a standard
probabilistic calibration scheme is capable of accurately characterizing
uncertainty. Furthermore, two additional conditions are defined for suboptimal
models that determine when the simplifications can be safely ignored. The first
allows a suboptimally simplified model to be used in a way that replicates the
performance of an optimal model. This is achieved through the judicial
selection of a prior term for the calibration process that explicitly includes
the nature of the data, predictions and modelling simplifications. The second
considers the dependency structure between the predictions and the available
data to gain insights into when the simplifications can be overcome by using
the right calibration data. Furthermore, the derived conditions are related to
the commonly used calibration schemes based on Tikhonov and subspace
regularization. To allow concrete insights to be obtained, the analysis is
performed under a linear expansion of the model equations and where the
predictive uncertainty is characterized via second order moments only.","['George M. Mathews', 'John Vial']","['stat.ML', 'math.PR', 'physics.comp-ph', 'physics.geo-ph', 'stat.ME', '62F15, 62C10, 68U05, 93E12, 93B11, 62P12']",2017-03-21 13:02:35+00:00

unclear whether the fixed point identified by the variational inference

constructing iterative optimization algorithms for variational inference
problems that are guaranteed to converge to the $\epsilon$-global variational
lower bound on the log-likelihood. We derive inference algorithms for two
variational approximations to a standard Bayesian Gaussian mixture model
(BGMM). We present a minimal data set for empirically testing convergence and
show that a variational inference algorithm frequently converges to a local
optimum while our algorithm always converges to the globally optimal
variational lower bound. We characterize the loss incurred by choosing a
non-optimal variational approximation distribution suggesting that selection of
the approximating variational distribution deserves as much attention as the
selection of the original statistical model for a given data set.","['Hachem Saddiki', 'Andrew C. Trapp', 'Patrick Flaherty']","['stat.ME', 'stat.ML']",2017-03-21 12:33:19+00:00

http://arxiv.org/abs/1703.07047v3,High-Resolution Breast Cancer Screening with Multi-View Deep Convolutional Neural Networks,"Advances in deep learning for natural images have prompted a surge of
interest in applying similar techniques to medical images. The majority of the
initial attempts focused on replacing the input of a deep convolutional neural
network with a medical image, which does not take into consideration the
fundamental differences between these two types of images. Specifically, fine
details are necessary for detection in medical images, unlike in natural images
where coarse structures matter most. This difference makes it inadequate to use
the existing network architectures developed for natural images, because they
work on heavily downscaled images to reduce the memory requirements. This hides
details necessary to make accurate predictions. Additionally, a single exam in
medical imaging often comes with a set of views which must be fused in order to
reach a correct conclusion. In our work, we propose to use a multi-view deep
convolutional neural network that handles a set of high-resolution medical
images. We evaluate it on large-scale mammography-based breast cancer screening
(BI-RADS prediction) using 886,000 images. We focus on investigating the impact
of the training set size and image size on the prediction accuracy. Our results
highlight that performance increases with the size of training set, and that
the best performance can only be achieved using the original resolution. In the

hierarchical nonparametric variational autoencoders, which combines
tree-structured Bayesian nonparametric priors with VAEs, to enable infinite

Bayesian priors are learned jointly using tailored variational inference. The
resulting model induces a hierarchical structure of latent semantic concepts
underlying the data corpus, and infers accurate representations of data

relevance and its position on the results page. The position based model
explains this behavior by ascribing to every item an attraction probability,
and to every position an examination probability. To be clicked, a result must
be both attractive and examined. The probabilities of an item-position pair
being clicked thus form the entries of a rank-$1$ matrix. We propose the
learning problem of a Bernoulli rank-$1$ bandit where at each step, the
learning agent chooses a pair of row and column arms, and receives the product
of their Bernoulli-distributed values as a reward. This is a special case of
the stochastic rank-$1$ bandit problem considered in recent work that proposed
an elimination based algorithm Rank1Elim, and showed that Rank1Elim's regret
scales linearly with the number of rows and columns on ""benign"" instances.
These are the instances where the minimum of the average row and column rewards
$\mu$ is bounded away from zero. The issue with Rank1Elim is that it fails to
be competitive with straightforward bandit strategies as $\mu \rightarrow 0$.
In this paper we propose Rank1ElimKL which simply replaces the (crude)
confidence intervals of Rank1Elim with confidence intervals based on
Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergences, and with the help of a novel result
concerning the scaling of KL divergences we prove that with this change, our
algorithm will be competitive no matter the value of $\mu$. Experiments with
synthetic data confirm that on benign instances the performance of Rank1ElimKL
is significantly better than that of even Rank1Elim, while experiments with
models derived from real data confirm that the improvements are significant

to the spectral sum function or applying moment matching in Wasserstein
distance to recover the singular values. The main technical challenge is in
accurately estimating the Schatten norms from a sampling of a matrix. We
introduce a novel unbiased estimator based on counting small structures in a

theoretical analysis shows that Schatten norms can be recovered accurately from
strictly smaller number of samples compared to what is needed to recover the

Stochastically ""dropping out"" units with a certain probability discourages
over-specific co-adaptations of feature detectors, preventing overfitting and

approximate model aggregation technique, where an exponential number of smaller
networks are averaged in order to get a more powerful ensemble. In this paper,
we show that using a fixed dropout probability during training is a suboptimal

neurons in the network. This induces an adaptive regularization scheme that
smoothly increases the difficulty of the optimization problem. This idea of
""starting easy"" and adaptively increasing the difficulty of the learning

models. Indeed, we prove that our optimization strategy implements a very
general curriculum scheme, by gradually adding noise to both the input and
intermediate feature representations within the network architecture.

to sequentially select a set of tests with a minimal cost, so that one can
efficiently make the best decision based on the observed outcomes. Existing

exponential run time in terms of the number of available tests). Moreover,
these methods assume a known distribution over the test outcomes, which is
often not the case in practice. We propose an efficient sampling-based online

distribution over hypotheses is known, we propose a dynamic hypothesis
enumeration strategy, which allows efficient information gathering with strong
theoretical guarantees. We show that with sufficient amount of samples, one can
identify a near-optimal decision with high probability. Second, when the
parameters of the hypotheses distribution are unknown, we propose an algorithm

(targets) given global knowledge of the network topology and its edge weights
under a query budget. However, in most networks, nodes, topology and edge
weights are all initially unknown. We introduce selective harvesting, a variant
of AS where the next node to be queried must be chosen among the neighbors of
the current queried node set; the available training data for deciding which
node to query is restricted to the subgraph induced by the queried set (and
their node attributes) and their neighbors (without any node or edge
attributes). Therefore, selective harvesting is a sequential decision problem,
where we must decide which node to query at each step. A classifier trained in
this scenario suffers from a tunnel vision effect: without recourse to
independent sampling, the urge to query promising nodes forces classifiers to
gather increasingly biased training data, which we show significantly hurts the
performance of AS methods and standard classifiers. We find that it is possible
to collect a much larger set of targets by using multiple classifiers, not by
combining their predictions as an ensemble, but switching between classifiers
used at each step, as a way to ease the tunnel vision effect. We discover that
switching classifiers collects more targets by (a) diversifying the training
data and (b) broadening the choices of nodes that can be queried next. This
highlights an exploration, exploitation, and diversification trade-off in our
problem that goes beyond the exploration and exploitation duality found in
classic sequential decision problems. From these observations we propose D3TS,

settings, we develop a simple, efficient implementation that requires only
oracle access to gradients and Hessian-vector products. We show that even on
non-convex and non-differentiable models where the theory breaks down,
approximations to influence functions can still provide valuable information.
On linear models and convolutional neural networks, we demonstrate that
influence functions are useful for multiple purposes: understanding model
behavior, debugging models, detecting dataset errors, and even creating
visually-indistinguishable training-set attacks.","['Pang Wei Koh', 'Percy Liang']","['stat.ML', 'cs.AI', 'cs.LG']",2017-03-14 21:07:01+00:00
http://arxiv.org/abs/1703.06912v1,Application of backpropagation neural networks to both stages of fingerprinting based WIPS,"We propose a scheme to employ backpropagation neural networks (BPNNs) for
both stages of fingerprinting-based indoor positioning using WLAN/WiFi signal
strengths (FWIPS): radio map construction during the offline stage, and
localization during the online stage. Given a training radio map (TRM), i.e., a
set of coordinate vectors and associated WLAN/WiFi signal strengths of the
available access points, a BPNN can be trained to output the expected signal
strengths for any input position within the region of interest (BPNN-RM). This
can be used to provide a continuous representation of the radio map and to
filter, densify or decimate a discrete radio map. Correspondingly, the TRM can
also be used to train another BPNN to output the expected position within the
region of interest for any input vector of recorded signal strengths and thus
carry out localization (BPNN-LA).Key aspects of the design of such artificial
neural networks for a specific application are the selection of design
parameters like the number of hidden layers and nodes within the network, and
the training procedure. Summarizing extensive numerical simulations, based on
real measurements in a testbed, we analyze the impact of these design choices
on the performance of the BPNN and compare the results in particular to those
obtained using the $k$ nearest neighbors ($k$NN) and weighted $k$ nearest

http://arxiv.org/abs/1703.04697v1,On the benefits of output sparsity for multi-label classification,"The multi-label classification framework, where each observation can be
associated with a set of labels, has generated a tremendous amount of attention
over recent years. The modern multi-label problems are typically large-scale in
terms of number of observations, features and labels, and the amount of labels
can even be comparable with the amount of observations. In this context,
different remedies have been proposed to overcome the curse of dimensionality.
In this work, we aim at exploiting the output sparsity by introducing a new
loss, called the sparse weighted Hamming loss. This proposed loss can be seen
as a weighted version of classical ones, where active and inactive labels are
weighted separately. Leveraging the influence of sparsity in the loss function,
we provide improved generalization bounds for the empirical risk minimizer, a
suitable property for large-scale problems. For this new loss, we derive rates
of convergence linear in the underlying output-sparsity rather than linear in
the number of labels. In practice, minimizing the associated risk can be
performed efficiently by using convex surrogates and modern convex optimization
algorithms. We provide experiments on various real-world datasets demonstrating
the pertinence of our approach when compared to non-weighted techniques.","['Evgenii Chzhen', 'Christophe Denis', 'Mohamed Hebiri', 'Joseph Salmon']","['math.ST', 'cs.LG', 'stat.ML', 'stat.TH']",2017-03-14 20:19:08+00:00

concept so-called self-concordance introduced by Nesterov and Nemirovskii in
the early 1990s to a broader class of convex functions, which we call
generalized self-concordant functions. This notion allows us to develop a
unified framework for designing Newton-type methods to solve convex optimiza-
tion problems. The proposed theory provides a mathematical tool to analyze both
local and global convergence of Newton-type methods without imposing
unverifiable assumptions as long as the un- derlying functionals fall into our
generalized self-concordant function class. First, we introduce the class of
generalized self-concordant functions, which covers standard self-concordant
functions as a special case. Next, we establish several properties and key
estimates of this function class, which can be used to design numerical
methods. Then, we apply this theory to develop several Newton-type methods for
solving a class of smooth convex optimization problems involving the
generalized self- concordant functions. We provide an explicit step-size for
the damped-step Newton-type scheme which can guarantee a global convergence
without performing any globalization strategy. We also prove a local quadratic
convergence of this method and its full-step variant without requiring the
Lipschitz continuity of the objective Hessian. Then, we extend our result to
develop proximal Newton-type methods for a class of composite convex
minimization problems involving generalized self-concordant functions. We also
achieve both global and local convergence without additional assumption.
Finally, we verify our theoretical results via several numerical examples, and
compare them with existing methods.","['Tianxiao Sun', 'Quoc Tran-Dinh']","['math.OC', 'stat.ML']",2017-03-14 17:23:02+00:00

for multi-output prediction. The existing method for this model is to
re-formulate the matrix-variate Gaussian distribution as a multivariate normal
distribution. Although it is effective in many cases, re-formulation is not
always workable and is difficult to apply to other distributions because not
all matrix-variate distributions can be transformed to respective multivariate
distributions, such as the case for matrix-variate Student$-t$ distribution. In
this paper, we propose a unified framework which is used not only to introduce
a novel multivariate Student$-t$ process regression model (MV-TPR) for
multi-output prediction, but also to reformulate the multivariate Gaussian
process regression (MV-GPR) that overcomes some limitations of the existing
methods. Both MV-GPR and MV-TPR have closed-form expressions for the marginal
likelihoods and predictive distributions under this unified framework and thus
can adopt the same optimization approaches as used in the conventional GPR. The
usefulness of the proposed methods is illustrated through several simulated and

superiority for the datasets considered, including air quality prediction and

known to lead to an illusion of grammaticality. As discussed in the
meta-analysis by Jaeger et al., 2017, faster reading times are observed at the
verb are in the agreement-attraction sentence above compared to the equally
ungrammatical sentence ""The key to the cabinet are on the table"". One
explanation for this facilitation effect is the feature percolation account:
the plural feature on cabinets percolates up to the head noun key, leading to
the illusion. An alternative account is in terms of cue-based retrieval (Lewis
& Vasishth, 2005), which assumes that the non-subject noun cabinets is
misretrieved due to a partial feature-match when a dependency completion
process at the auxiliary initiates a memory access for a subject with plural
marking. We present evidence for yet another explanation for the observed
facilitation. Because the second sentence has two nouns with identical number,
it is possible that these are, in some proportion of trials, more difficult to
keep distinct, leading to slower reading times at the verb in the first
sentence above; this is the feature overwriting account of Nairne, 1990. We
show that the feature overwriting proposal can be implemented as a finite
mixture process. We reanalysed ten published data-sets, fitting hierarchical
Bayesian mixture models to these data assuming a two-mixture distribution. We
show that in nine out of the ten studies, a mixture distribution corresponding
to feature overwriting furnishes a superior fit over both the feature
percolation and the cue-based retrieval accounts.","['Shravan Vasishth', 'Lena A. JÃ¤ger', 'Bruno Nicenboim']","['stat.ML', 'cs.CL', 'stat.AP']",2017-03-12 08:11:29+00:00
