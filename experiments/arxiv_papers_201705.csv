distribution from samples. It is however well known that GAN training suffers
from instability due to the nature of its maximin formulation. In this paper,
we explore ways to tackle the instability problem by dualizing the
discriminator. We start from linear discriminators in which case conjugate
duality provides a mechanism to reformulate the saddle point objective into a
maximization problem, such that both the generator and the discriminator of
this 'dualing GAN' act in concert. We then demonstrate how to extend this
intuition to non-linear formulations. For GANs with linear discriminators our
approach is able to remove the instability in training, while for GANs with
nonlinear discriminators our approach provides an alternative to the commonly
used GAN training algorithm.","['Yujia Li', 'Alexander Schwing', 'Kuan-Chieh Wang', 'Richard Zemel']","['cs.LG', 'cs.AI', 'cs.CV', 'stat.ML']",2017-06-19 23:28:49+00:00
http://arxiv.org/abs/1706.06195v1,Unsure When to Stop? Ask Your Semantic Neighbors,"In iterative supervised learning algorithms it is common to reach a point in
the search where no further induction seems to be possible with the available
data. If the search is continued beyond this point, the risk of overfitting
increases significantly. Following the recent developments in inductive
semantic stochastic methods, this paper studies the feasibility of using
information gathered from the semantic neighborhood to decide when to stop the
search. Two semantic stopping criteria are proposed and experimentally assessed
in Geometric Semantic Genetic Programming (GSGP) and in the Semantic Learning
Machine (SLM) algorithm (the equivalent algorithm for neural networks). The
experiments are performed on real-world high-dimensional regression datasets.
The results show that the proposed semantic stopping criteria are able to
detect stopping points that result in a competitive generalization for both
GSGP and SLM. This approach also yields computationally efficient algorithms as
it allows the evolution of neural networks in less than 3 seconds on average,
and of GP trees in at most 10 seconds. The usage of the proposed semantic
stopping criteria in conjunction with the computation of optimal
mutation/learning steps also results in small trees and neural networks.","['Ivo Gonçalves', 'Sara Silva', 'Carlos M. Fonseca', 'Mauro Castelli']","['cs.NE', 'cs.LG', 'stat.ML']",2017-06-19 22:29:08+00:00

forest to estimate its prediction variance. These theorems were verified under
a traditional random forest framework which uses classification and regression
trees (CART) and bootstrap resampling. However, random forests using
conditional inference (CI) trees and subsampling have been found to be not
prone to variable selection bias. Here, we conduct simulation experiments using
a novel approach to explore the applicability of the IJ to random forests using
variations on the resampling method and base learner. Test data points were
simulated and each trained using random forest on one hundred simulated
training data sets using different combinations of resampling and base
learners. Using CI trees instead of traditional CART trees as well as using
subsampling instead of bootstrap sampling resulted in a much more accurate
estimation of prediction variance when using the IJ. The random forest
variations here have been incorporated into an open source software package for
the R programming language.","['Cole Brokamp', 'MB Rao', 'Patrick Ryan', 'Roman Jandarov']",['stat.ML'],2017-06-19 19:32:05+00:00
http://arxiv.org/abs/1706.06136v2,Element-centric clustering comparison unifies overlaps and hierarchy,"Clustering is one of the most universal approaches for understanding complex
data. A pivotal aspect of clustering analysis is quantitatively comparing
clusterings; clustering comparison is the basis for many tasks such as
clustering evaluation, consensus clustering, and tracking the temporal
evolution of clusters. In particular, the extrinsic evaluation of clustering
methods requires comparing the uncovered clusterings to planted clusterings or
known metadata. Yet, as we demonstrate, existing clustering comparison measures
have critical biases which undermine their usefulness, and no measure
accommodates both overlapping and hierarchical clusterings. Here we unify the
comparison of disjoint, overlapping, and hierarchically structured clusterings
by proposing a new element-centric framework: elements are compared based on
the relationships induced by the cluster structure, as opposed to the
traditional cluster-centric philosophy. We demonstrate that, in contrast to
standard clustering similarity measures, our framework does not suffer from
critical biases and naturally provides unique insights into how the clusterings
differ. We illustrate the strengths of our framework by revealing new insights
into the organization of clusters in two applications: the improved
classification of schizophrenia based on the overlapping and hierarchical
community structure of fMRI brain networks, and the disentanglement of various
social homophily factors in Facebook social networks. The universality of
clustering suggests far-reaching impact of our framework throughout all areas
of science.","['Alexander J. Gates', 'Ian B. Wood', 'William P. Hetrick', 'Yong-Yeol Ahn']","['stat.ML', 'cs.LG']",2017-06-19 18:51:43+00:00

adversarial examples---inputs that are almost indistinguishable from natural
data and yet classified incorrectly by the network. In fact, some of the latest
findings suggest that the existence of adversarial attacks may be an inherent
weakness of deep learning models. To address this problem, we study the
adversarial robustness of neural networks through the lens of robust
optimization. This approach provides us with a broad and unifying view on much
of the prior work on this topic. Its principled nature also enables us to
identify methods for both training and attacking neural networks that are
reliable and, in a certain sense, universal. In particular, they specify a
concrete security guarantee that would protect against any adversary. These
methods let us train networks with significantly improved resistance to a wide
range of adversarial attacks. They also suggest the notion of security against
a first-order adversary as a natural and broad security guarantee. We believe
that robustness against such well-defined classes of adversaries is an
important stepping stone towards fully resistant deep learning models. Code and

restricted strong convexity and Hessian smoothness), we prove that within each

convergence, and eventually obtains a sparse approximate local optimum with
optimal statistical properties after only a few convex relaxations. Numerical

arXiv:1802.03888
  It is critical in many applications to understand what features are important
for a model, and why individual predictions were made. For tree ensemble
methods these questions are usually answered by attributing importance values
to input features, either globally or for a single prediction. Here we show
that current feature attribution methods are inconsistent, which means changing
the model to rely more on a given feature can actually decrease the importance
assigned to that feature. To address this problem we develop fast exact
solutions for SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanation) values, which were recently
shown to be the unique additive feature attribution method based on conditional
expectations that is both consistent and locally accurate. We integrate these
improvements into the latest version of XGBoost, demonstrate the
inconsistencies of current methods, and show how using SHAP values results in
significantly improved supervised clustering performance. Feature importance
values are a key part of understanding widely used models such as gradient
boosting trees and random forests, so improvements to them have broad practical

outcome-specific layers. The impact of selection bias in the observational data
is alleviated via a propensity-dropout regularization scheme, in which the
network is thinned for every training example via a dropout probability that
depends on the associated propensity score. The network is trained in
alternating phases, where in each phase we use the training examples of one of
the two potential outcomes (treated and control populations) to update the
weights of the shared layers and the respective outcome-specific layers.

number d of variables is large, the sample estimates of correlation matrices
are typically noisy and conceal underlying dependence patterns. We consider the
case when the variables can be grouped into K clusters with exchangeable
dependence; this assumption is often made in applications, e.g., in finance and
econometrics. Under this partial exchangeability condition, the corresponding
correlation matrix has a block structure and the number of unknown parameters
is reduced from d(d-1)/2 to at most K(K+1)/2. We propose a robust algorithm
based on Kendall's rank correlation to identify the clusters without assuming
the knowledge of K a priori or anything about the margins except continuity.
The corresponding block-structured estimator performs considerably better than
the sample Kendall rank correlation matrix when K < d. The new estimator can
also be much more efficient in finite samples even in the unstructured case K =
d, although there is no gain asymptotically. When the distribution of the data
is elliptical, the results extend to linear correlation matrices and their
inverses. The procedure is illustrated on financial stock returns.","['Samuel Perreault', 'Thierry Duchesne', 'Johanna G. Nešlehová']","['math.ST', 'stat.ML', 'stat.TH']",2017-06-19 13:45:21+00:00

they are automatically adapted during the training of the model, resulting in a
variation of the Frank-Wolfe optimization algorithm with essentially the same
computational complexity as the original algorithm. As shown experimentally,
this algorithm is computationally cheaper to apply since it requires less

machine learning, achieving many state-of-art results. It becomes increasingly
important to understand why they can work for these NP-hard problems on typical
data. The landscape of many objective functions in learning has been
conjectured to have the geometric property that ""all local optima are
(approximately) global optima"", and thus they can be solved efficiently by
local search algorithms. However, establishing such property can be very
difficult.
  In this paper, we analyze the optimization landscape of the random
over-complete tensor decomposition problem, which has many applications in
unsupervised learning, especially in learning latent variable models. In
practice, it can be efficiently solved by gradient ascent on a non-convex
objective. We show that for any small constant $\epsilon > 0$, among the set of
points with function values $(1+\epsilon)$-factor larger than the expectation
of the function, all the local maxima are approximate global maxima.
Previously, the best-known result only characterizes the geometry in small
neighborhoods around the true components. Our result implies that even with an
initialization that is barely better than the random guess, the gradient ascent
algorithm is guaranteed to solve this problem.

temporal structure of event-based signals. However, some spike-timing-related
strengths of SNNs are hindered by the sensitivity of spike-timing-dependent

be obstructed by coarser correlations between firing rates. In this article, we
propose a spike-timing-dependent learning rule that allows a neuron to learn
from the temporally-coded information despite the presence of rate codes. Our
long-term plasticity rule makes use of short-term synaptic fatigue dynamics. We
show analytically that, in contrast to conventional STDP rules, our fatiguing

conditions to optimize the learning process. We showcase the effectiveness of
FSTDP in learning spike-timing correlations among processes of different rates

non-negative continuous data with a discrete probability mass at zero. Mixed
models with random effects account for the covariance structure related to the
grouping hierarchy in the data. An important application of Tweedie mixed
models is pricing the insurance policies, e.g. car insurance. However, the
intractable likelihood function, the unknown variance function, and the
hierarchical structure of mixed effects have presented considerable challenges
for drawing inferences on Tweedie. In this study, we tackle the Bayesian
Tweedie mixed-effects models via variational inference approaches. In
particular, we empower the posterior approximation by implicit models trained
in an adversarial setting. To reduce the variance of gradients, we
reparameterize random effects, and integrate out one local latent variable of
Tweedie. We also employ a flexible hyper prior to ensure the richness of the
approximation. Our method is evaluated on both simulated and real-world data.
Results show that the proposed method has smaller estimation bias on the random
effects compared to traditional inference methods including MCMC; it also
achieves a state-of-the-art predictive performance, meanwhile offering a richer

with dataset size. A popular class of methods for solving this issue is
stochastic gradient MCMC. These methods use a noisy estimate of the gradient of
the log posterior, which reduces the per iteration computational cost of the
algorithm. Despite this, there are a number of results suggesting that
stochastic gradient Langevin dynamics (SGLD), probably the most popular of
these methods, still has computational cost proportional to the dataset size.
We suggest an alternative log posterior gradient estimate for stochastic
gradient MCMC, which uses control variates to reduce the variance. We analyse
SGLD using this gradient estimate, and show that, under log-concavity
assumptions on the target distribution, the computational cost required for a
given level of accuracy is independent of the dataset size. Next we show that a
different control variate technique, known as zero variance control variates
can be applied to SGMCMC algorithms for free. This post-processing step
improves the inference of the algorithm by reducing the variance of the MCMC
output. Zero variance control variates rely on the gradient of the log
posterior; we explore how the variance reduction is affected by replacing this
with the noisy gradient estimate calculated by SGMCMC.","['Jack Baker', 'Paul Fearnhead', 'Emily B. Fox', 'Christopher Nemeth']","['stat.CO', 'cs.LG', 'stat.ML']",2017-06-16 22:00:54+00:00

recognition. The success of these models however relies on the use of
sophisticated recipes and complicated machinery that is not easily accessible
to non-practitioners. Recent innovations in Deep Learning have given rise to an
alternative - discriminative models called Sequence-to-Sequence models, that
can almost match the accuracy of state of the art generative models. While
these models are easy to train as they can be trained end-to-end in a single
step, they have a practical limitation that they can only be used for offline
recognition. This is because the models require that the entirety of the input
sequence be available at the beginning of inference, an assumption that is not
valid for instantaneous speech recognition. To address this problem, online
sequence-to-sequence models were recently introduced. These models are able to
start producing outputs as data arrives, and the model feels confident enough
to output partial transcripts. These models, like sequence-to-sequence are
causal - the output produced by the model until any time, $t$, affects the
features that are computed subsequently. This makes the model inherently more
powerful than generative models that are unable to change features that are
computed from the data. This paper highlights two main contributions - an
improvement to online sequence-to-sequence model training, and its application
to noisy settings with mixed speech from two speakers.","['Chung-Cheng Chiu', 'Dieterich Lawson', 'Yuping Luo', 'George Tucker', 'Kevin Swersky', 'Ilya Sutskever', 'Navdeep Jaitly']","['cs.CL', 'cs.LG', 'stat.ML']",2017-06-16 20:58:43+00:00

continuous monitoring of each MAB test; and (iii) to show that using rejection

labeling data: an unlabeled dataset (target) is annotated using a labeled

stability is proposed, motivated by a generalization error bound for large
margin linear classifiers: a target labeling is stable when, with high
probability, a classifier trained on a random subsample of the target with that
labeling yields the same labeling. We find stable labelings using a random walk
on a directed graph with transition probabilities based on labeling stability.
The majority vote of those labelings visited by the walk yields a stable label
for each target example. The resulting domain adaptation algorithm is
strikingly easy to implement and apply: It does not rely on data
transformations, which are in general computational prohibitive in the presence
of many input features, and does not need to access the source data, which is
advantageous when data sharing is restricted. By acting on the original feature

recover the vanished features and exploit it to improve performance.
Specifically, we learn two models from the recovered features and the current

ensemble methods. In the first method, we combine the predictions from two
models and theoretically show that with the assistance of old features, the
performance on new features can be improved. In the second approach, we

http://arxiv.org/abs/1706.04692v1,Bias and high-dimensional adjustment in observational studies of peer effects,"Peer effects, in which the behavior of an individual is affected by the
behavior of their peers, are posited by multiple theories in the social
sciences. Other processes can also produce behaviors that are correlated in
networks and groups, thereby generating debate about the credibility of
observational (i.e. nonexperimental) studies of peer effects. Randomized field
experiments that identify peer effects, however, are often expensive or
infeasible. Thus, many studies of peer effects use observational data, and
prior evaluations of causal inference methods for adjusting observational data
to estimate peer effects have lacked an experimental ""gold standard"" for
comparison. Here we show, in the context of information and media diffusion on
Facebook, that high-dimensional adjustment of a nonexperimental control group
(677 million observations) using propensity score models produces estimates of
peer effects statistically indistinguishable from those from using a large
randomized experiment (220 million observations). Naive observational
estimators overstate peer effects by 320% and commonly used variables (e.g.,
demographics) offer little bias reduction, but adjusting for a measure of prior
behaviors closely related to the focal behavior reduces bias by 91%.
High-dimensional models adjusting for over 3,700 past behaviors provide
additional bias reduction, such that the full model reduces bias by over 97%.
This experimental evaluation demonstrates that detailed records of individuals'
past behavior can improve studies of social influence, information diffusion,
and imitation; these results are encouraging for the credibility of some
studies but also cautionary for studies of rare or new behaviors. More
generally, these results show how large, high-dimensional data sets and
statistical learning techniques can be used to improve causal inference in the
behavioral sciences.","['Dean Eckles', 'Eytan Bakshy']","['stat.ME', 'cs.SI', 'stat.AP', 'stat.ML', '62P25, 62P30, 91D30', 'G.3; J.4']",2017-06-14 23:21:37+00:00

rearrangements in thermalized systems are the transition paths of largest

when ab initio or electron density functional calculations are used to evaluate
the energy and atomic forces. Here, we show how the number of such evaluations

transition state theory, the evaluation of the Hessian matrix at the initial

minimum energy path calculation, thereby improving stability and reducing the
number of iterations needed for convergence. A Gaussian process model also
provides an uncertainty estimate for the approximate energy surface, and this
can be used to focus the calculations on the lesser-known part of the path,

  Objectives: This study introduces $\nu$-net (/nju:n$\varepsilon$t/) -- a deep
learning approach allowing for fully-automated high quality segmentation of
right (RV) and left ventricular (LV) endocardium and epicardium for extraction
of cardiac function parameters.
  Methods: A set consisting of 253 manually segmented cases has been used to
train a deep neural network. Subsequently, the network has been evaluated on 4
different multicenter data sets with a total of over 1000 cases.
  Results: For LV EF the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) is 98, 95,

clustering problem. Underpinning the proposed method is a convex program for
optimal direction search, which for each data point d finds an optimal
direction in the span of the data that has minimum projection on the other data
points and non-vanishing projection on d. The obtained directions are
subsequently leveraged to identify a neighborhood set for each data point. An
alternating direction method of multipliers framework is provided to
efficiently solve for the optimal directions. The proposed method is shown to

generating the observed properties of a set of objects. It is often used to
make predictions either for new values of interest or missing information in
the original data, as well as to perform data exploratory analysis. However,
although there is an extensive literature on latent feature models for
homogeneous datasets, where all the attributes that describe each object are of
the same (continuous or discrete) nature, there is a lack of work on latent
feature modeling for heterogeneous databases. In this paper, we introduce a
general Bayesian nonparametric latent feature model suitable for heterogeneous
datasets, where the attributes describing each object can be either discrete,
continuous or mixed variables. The proposed model presents several important
properties. First, it accounts for heterogeneous data while keeping the
properties of conjugate models, which allow us to infer the model in linear
time with respect to the number of objects and attributes. Second, its Bayesian
nonparametric nature allows us to automatically infer the model complexity from
the data, i.e., the number of features necessary to capture the latent
structure in the data. Third, the latent features in the model are
binary-valued variables, easing the interpretability of the obtained latent
features in data exploratory analysis. We show the flexibility of the proposed
model by solving both prediction and data analysis tasks on several real-world
datasets. Moreover, a software package of the GLFM is publicly available for
other researcher to use and improve it.","['Isabel Valera', 'Melanie F. Pradier', 'Maria Lomeli', 'Zoubin Ghahramani']",['stat.ML'],2017-06-12 18:00:03+00:00

better match the intuition and desired labeling of the user. The core of TS-NMF
