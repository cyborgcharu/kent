function is represented as a mixture of actual observations (functional
archetypoids) or functional archetypes, which are a mixture of observations in
the data set. Well-known Canadian temperature data are used to illustrate the
analysis developed. Computational methods are proposed for performing these
analyses, based on the coefficients of a basis. Unlike a previous attempt to
compute functional archetypes, which was only valid for an orthogonal basis,
the proposed methodology can be used for any basis. It is computationally less
demanding than the simple approach of discretizing the functions. Multivariate
functional archetype and archetypoid analysis are also introduced and applied
in an interesting problem about the study of human development around the world

procuring labels from multiple noisy crowd annotators, under a budget
constraint. We propose a Bayesian model for linear regression in crowdsourcing
and use variational inference for parameter estimation. To minimize the number
of labels crowdsourced from the annotators, we adopt an active learning
approach. In this specific context, we prove the equivalence of well-studied
criteria of active learning like entropy minimization and expected error
reduction. Interestingly, we observe that we can decouple the problems of
identifying an optimal unlabeled instance and identifying an annotator to label
it. We observe a useful connection between the multi-armed bandit framework and
the annotator selection in active learning. Due to the nature of the
distribution of the rewards on the arms, we use the Robust Upper Confidence
Bound (UCB) scheme with truncated empirical mean estimator to solve the
annotator selection problem. This yields provable guarantees on the regret. We
further apply our model to the scenario where annotators are strategic and
design suitable incentives to induce them to put in their best efforts.","['Divya Padmanabhan', 'Satyanath Bhat', 'Dinesh Garg', 'Shirish Shevade', 'Y. Narahari']","['cs.LG', 'stat.ML']",2016-01-25 20:14:22+00:00

instead forgets about old data in a smooth fashion. Our main contribution
comprises of novel regret bounds for these algorithms, providing an explicit
characterization of the trade-off between the time horizon and the rate at
which the function varies. We illustrate the performance of the algorithms on
both synthetic and real data, and we find the gradual forgetting of TV-GP-UCB
to perform favorably compared to the sharp resetting of R-GP-UCB. Moreover,
both algorithms significantly outperform classical GP-UCB, since it treats

containing information on two overlapping sets of entities. This is non-trivial

applications given that it needs to be solved whenever we have to combine

of record pairs to derive estimation procedures and optimal point estimators.
We argue that this independence assumption is unreasonable and instead target a
bipartite matching between the two datafiles as our parameter of interest.
Bayesian implementations allow us to quantify uncertainty on the matching
decisions and derive a variety of point estimators using different loss
functions. We propose partial Bayes estimates that allow uncertain parts of the
bipartite matching to be left unresolved. We evaluate our approach to record

the sparse non-negative least squares (S-NNLS) problem. We introduce a family

The R-GSM prior encompasses a variety of heavy-tailed densities such as the
rectified Laplacian and rectified Student- t distributions with a proper choice
of the mixing density. We utilize the hierarchical representation induced by
the R-GSM prior and develop an evidence maximization framework based on the
Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm. Using the EM based method, we estimate

the proposed method as rectified sparse Bayesian learning (R-SBL). We provide
four R- SBL variants that offer a range of options for computational complexity

Quantum models owe their success to their interpretability, to their relation

science. This motivates the use of quantum models to analyze general
nonphysical datasets. Here we provide both empirical and theoretical insights

efficient than probabilistic models because there exist datasets that admit
low-dimensional quantum models and only exponentially high-dimensional
probabilistic models. Secondly, we explain in what sense quantum models realize
a useful relaxation of compressed probabilistic models. Thirdly, we show that
sparse datasets admit low-dimensional quantum models and finally, we introduce

Conductance is a popular objective function used in many algorithms for local

graph spectra. However, the impact of the approximation of the spectrum on the
final generalization error is either unknown, or requires strong assumptions on

produce accurate and consistent estimates is to treat the pairwise comparisons
unequally, depending on the topology of the collected data. In this paper, we
provide the optimal rank-breaking estimator, which not only achieves
consistency but also achieves the best error bound. This allows us to

at scale and is widely used in social and network sciences. However, a major
criticism of Twitter data is that demographic information is largely absent.
Enhancing Twitter data with user ages would advance our ability to study social
network structures, information flows and the spread of contagions. Approaches
toward age detection of Twitter users typically focus on specific properties of
tweets, e.g., linguistic features, which are language dependent. In this paper,
we devise a language-independent methodology for determining the age of Twitter
users from data that is native to the Twitter ecosystem. The key idea is to use
a Bayesian framework to generalise ground-truth age information from a few
Twitter users to the entire network based on what/whom they follow. Our

http://arxiv.org/abs/1601.04586v4,Sparse Convex Clustering,"Convex clustering, a convex relaxation of k-means clustering and hierarchical
clustering, has drawn recent attentions since it nicely addresses the
instability issue of traditional nonconvex clustering methods. Although its
computational and statistical properties have been recently studied, the
performance of convex clustering has not yet been investigated in the
high-dimensional clustering scenario, where the data contains a large number of
features and many of them carry no information about the clustering structure.
In this paper, we demonstrate that the performance of convex clustering could
be distorted when the uninformative features are included in the clustering. To
overcome it, we introduce a new clustering method, referred to as Sparse Convex
Clustering, to simultaneously cluster observations and conduct feature
selection. The key idea is to formulate convex clustering in a form of
regularization, with an adaptive group-lasso penalty term on cluster centers.
In order to optimally balance the tradeoff between the cluster fitting and
sparsity, a tuning criterion based on clustering stability is developed. In
theory, we provide an unbiased estimator for the degrees of freedom of the
proposed sparse convex clustering method. Finally, the effectiveness of the
sparse convex clustering is examined through a variety of numerical experiments
and a real data application.","['Binhuan Wang', 'Yilong Zhang', 'Will Wei Sun', 'Yixin Fang']","['stat.ME', 'cs.LG', 'stat.ML']",2016-01-18 16:03:35+00:00

kernel learning algorithms.
  We present the Mklaren algorithm to approximate multiple kernel matrices

the correlations between all kernels. It uses Incomplete Cholesky
decomposition, where pivot selection is based on least-angle regression in the
combined, low-dimensional feature space. The algorithm has linear complexity in
the number of data points and kernels. When explicit feature space induced by
the kernel can be constructed, a mapping from the dual to the primal Ridge
regression weights is used for model interpretation.
  The Mklaren algorithm was tested on eight standard regression datasets. It
outperforms contemporary kernel matrix approximation approaches when learning
with multiple kernels. It identifies relevant kernels, achieving highest
explained variance than other multiple kernel learning methods for the same

dimensions, such as the choice of cost function and the appropriateness of
minimizing the empirical average training cost, along which certain real-world
applications may not be completely amenable to the foundational principle of

minimization is sufficient (we name these Type B applications). Finally, we
discuss how four different strategies for achieving safety in engineering

hierarchical GSFA (HGSFA) allows learning from images and other
high-dimensional data. The feature space spanned by HGSFA is complex due to the

is to approximate posterior probabilities of positive and negative classes for
a previously unseen data point. This problem can be decomposed into two steps:
(i) the development of accurate predictors that discriminate between positive
and unlabeled data, and (ii) the accurate estimation of the prior probabilities
of positive and negative examples. In this work we primarily focus on the
latter subproblem. We study nonparametric class prior estimation and formulate
this problem as an estimation of mixing proportions in two-component mixture
models, given a sample from one of the components and another sample from the
mixture itself. We show that estimation of mixing proportions is generally
ill-defined and propose a canonical form to obtain identifiability while
maintaining the flexibility to model any distribution. We use insights from
this theory to elucidate the optimization surface of the class priors and
propose an algorithm for estimating them. To address the problems of
high-dimensional density estimation, we provide practical transformations to
low-dimensional spaces that preserve class priors. Finally, we demonstrate the

hypothesized to represent a signature of ongoing stochastic inference in the
brain. More recently, a theoretical framework for neural sampling has been
proposed, which explains how sample-based inference can be performed by
networks of spiking neurons. One particular requirement of this approach is
that the neural response function closely follows a logistic curve.
  Analytical approaches to calculating neural response functions have been the
subject of many theoretical studies. In order to make the problem tractable,
particular assumptions regarding the neural or synaptic parameters are usually
made. However, biologically significant activity regimes exist which are not
covered by these approaches: Under strong synaptic bombardment, as is often the
case in cortex, the neuron is shifted into a high-conductance state (HCS)
characterized by a small membrane time constant. In this regime, synaptic time
constants and refractory periods dominate membrane dynamics.
  The core idea of our approach is to separately consider two different ""modes""
of spiking dynamics: burst spiking and transient quiescence, in which the
neuron does not spike for longer periods. We treat the former by propagating
the PDF of the effective membrane potential from spike to spike within a burst,
while using a diffusion approximation for the latter. We find that our
prediction of the neural response function closely matches simulation data.
Moreover, in the HCS scenario, we show that the neural response function
becomes symmetric and can be well approximated by a logistic function, thereby
providing the correct dynamics in order to perform neural sampling. We hereby
provide not only a normative framework for Bayesian inference in cortex, but
also powerful applications of low-power, accelerated neuromorphic systems to
relevant machine learning tasks.","['Mihai A. Petrovici', 'Ilja Bytschok', 'Johannes Bill', 'Johannes Schemmel', 'Karlheinz Meier']","['q-bio.NC', 'cond-mat.dis-nn', 'cs.NE', 'physics.bio-ph', 'stat.ML']",2016-01-05 17:15:37+00:00

attempt to represent data using a set of representative $k$-dimensional
vectors, and include non-negative matrix factorization, dictionary learning,
sparse coding, $k$-means clustering and vector quantization as special cases.
Previous generalization bounds for the reconstruction error of the
$k$-dimensional coding schemes are mainly dimensionality independent. A major
advantage of these bounds is that they can be used to analyze the
generalization error when data is mapped into an infinite- or high-dimensional
feature space. However, many applications use finite-dimensional data features.
Can we obtain dimensionality-dependent generalization bounds for
$k$-dimensional coding schemes that are tighter than dimensionality-independent
bounds when data is in a finite-dimensional feature space? The answer is
positive. In this paper, we address this problem and derive a
dimensionality-dependent generalization bound for $k$-dimensional coding
schemes by bounding the covering number of the loss function class induced by
the reconstruction error. The bound is of order
$\mathcal{O}\left(\left(mk\ln(mkn)/n\right)^{\lambda_n}\right)$, where $m$ is
the dimension of features, $k$ is the number of the columns in the linear
implementation of coding schemes, $n$ is the size of sample, $\lambda_n>0.5$

bound can be tighter than previous results, because it avoids inducing the
worst-case upper bound on $k$ of the loss function and converges faster. The
proposed generalization bound is also applied to some specific coding schemes

allocating small subsets of training data amongst a large set of classifiers.
The goal is to select a classifier that will give near-optimal accuracy when
trained on all data, while also minimizing the cost of misallocated samples.
This is motivated by large modern datasets and ML toolkits with many
combinations of learning algorithms and hyper-parameters. Inspired by the
principle of ""optimism under uncertainty,"" we propose an innovative strategy,
Data Allocation using Upper Bounds (DAUB), which robustly achieves these
objectives across a variety of real-world datasets.
  We further develop substantial theoretical support for DAUB in an idealized
setting where the expected accuracy of a classifier trained on $n$ samples can
be known exactly. Under these conditions we establish a rigorous sub-linear
bound on the regret of the approach (in terms of misallocated data), as well as
a rigorous bound on suboptimality of the selected classifier. Our accuracy
estimates using real-world datasets only entail mild violations of the
theoretical scenario, suggesting that the practical behavior of DAUB is likely
to approach the idealized behavior.","['Ashish Sabharwal', 'Horst Samulowitz', 'Gerald Tesauro']","['cs.LG', 'stat.ML']",2015-12-31 22:19:09+00:00
http://arxiv.org/abs/1512.09327v4,Distributed Bayesian Learning with Stochastic Natural-gradient Expectation Propagation and the Posterior Server,"This paper makes two contributions to Bayesian machine learning algorithms.
Firstly, we propose stochastic natural gradient expectation propagation (SNEP),
a novel alternative to expectation propagation (EP), a popular variational
inference algorithm. SNEP is a black box variational algorithm, in that it does
not require any simplifying assumptions on the distribution of interest, beyond
the existence of some Monte Carlo sampler for estimating the moments of the EP
tilted distributions. Further, as opposed to EP which has no guarantee of
convergence, SNEP can be shown to be convergent, even when using Monte Carlo
moment estimates. Secondly, we propose a novel architecture for distributed
Bayesian learning which we call the posterior server. The posterior server
allows scalable and robust Bayesian learning in cases where a data set is
stored in a distributed manner across a cluster, with each compute node
containing a disjoint subset of data. An independent Monte Carlo sampler is run
on each compute node, with direct access only to the local data subset, but
which targets an approximation to the global posterior distribution given all
data across the whole cluster. This is achieved by using a distributed
asynchronous implementation of SNEP to pass messages across the cluster. We
demonstrate SNEP and the posterior server on distributed Bayesian learning of
logistic regression and neural networks.

there exists a threshold such that if the extrapolation coefficients are chosen
below this threshold, then the sequence generated converges $R$-linearly to a
stationary point of the problem. Moreover, the corresponding sequence of
objective values is also $R$-linearly convergent. In addition, the threshold
reduces to $1$ for convex problems and, as a consequence, we obtain the

adequate capacity to digest massive datasets and offer powerful predictive
analytics thereupon. In order to run ML algorithms at such scales, on a
distributed cluster with 10s to 1000s of machines, it is often the case that
significant engineering efforts are required --- and one might fairly ask if
such engineering truly falls within the domain of ML research or not. Taking
the view that Big ML systems can benefit greatly from ML-rooted statistical and
algorithmic insights --- and that ML researchers should therefore not shy away
from such systems design --- we discuss a series of principles and strategies
distilled from our recent efforts on industrial-scale ML solutions. These
principles and strategies span a continuum from application, to engineering,
and to theoretical research and development of Big ML systems and
architectures, with the goal of understanding how to make them efficient,
generally-applicable, and supported with convergence and scaling guarantees.
They concern four key questions which traditionally receive little attention in
ML research: How to distribute an ML program over a cluster? How to bridge ML
computation with inter-machine communication? How to perform such
communication? What should be communicated between machines? By exposing
underlying statistical and algorithmic characteristics unique to ML programs
but not typically seen in traditional computer programs, and by dissecting
successful cases to reveal how we have harnessed these principles to design and
develop both high-performance distributed ML software as well as
general-purpose ML frameworks, we present opportunities for ML researchers and

important role in many scientific and industrial applications. Function
evaluations in many industrial applications are severely limited and no
analytical information about objective function and constraint functions is
available. For such expensive black-box optimization tasks, the constraint
optimization algorithm COBRA was proposed, making use of RBF surrogate modeling
for both the objective and the constraint functions. COBRA has shown remarkable
success in solving reliably complex benchmark problems in less than 500
function evaluations. Unfortunately, COBRA requires careful adjustment of
parameters in order to do so.
  In this work we present a new self-adjusting algorithm SACOBRA, which is
based on COBRA and capable to achieve high-quality results with very few
function evaluations and no parameter tuning. It is shown with the help of
performance profiles on a set of benchmark problems (G-problems, MOPTA08) that
SACOBRA consistently outperforms any COBRA algorithm with fixed parameter
setting. We analyze the importance of the several new elements in SACOBRA and
find that each element of SACOBRA plays a role to boost up the overall
optimization performance. We discuss the reasons behind and get in this way a

the generality of the projection matrices, we propose an approach to covariance

combinatorial structures. Based upon an oracle model of computation, which
captures the interactions between algorithms and data, we establish a general
lower bound that explicitly connects the minimum testing risk under
computational budget constraints with the intrinsic probabilistic and
combinatorial structures of statistical problems. This lower bound mirrors the
classical statistical lower bound by Le Cam (1986) and allows us to quantify
the optimal statistical performance achievable given limited computational
budgets in a systematic fashion. Under this unified framework, we sharply
characterize the statistical-computational phase transition for two testing
problems, namely, normal mean detection and sparse principal component
detection. For normal mean detection, we consider two combinatorial structures,
namely, sparse set and perfect matching. For these problems we identify
significant gaps between the optimal statistical accuracy that is achievable
under computational tractability constraints and the classical statistical
lower bounds. Compared with existing works on computational lower bounds for
statistical problems, which consider general polynomial-time algorithms on
Turing machines, and rely on computational hardness hypotheses on problems like
planted clique detection, we focus on the oracle computational model, which
covers a broad range of popular algorithms, and do not rely on unproven

large-scale inference. Using extreme-value form statistics to test against
sparse alternatives and using quadratic form statistics to test against dense
alternatives are two important testing procedures for high-dimensional
independence. However, quadratic form statistics suffer from low power against
sparse alternatives, and extreme-value form statistics suffer from low power
against dense alternatives with small disturbances and may have size
distortions due to its slow convergence. For real-world applications, it is
important to derive powerful testing procedures against more general
alternatives. Based on intermediate limiting distributions, we derive
(model-free) joint limiting laws of extreme-value form and quadratic form
statistics, and surprisingly, we prove that they are asymptotically
independent. Given such asymptotic independencies, we propose (model-free)
testing procedures to boost the power against general alternatives and also
retain the correct asymptotic size. Under the high-dimensional setting, we
derive the closed-form limiting null distributions, and obtain their explicit

Gaussian Graphical Models (GGMs), e.g. using sparse inverse covariance
estimators. Comparing functional connectivity of subjects in two populations
calls for comparing these estimated GGMs. Our goal is to identify differences
in GGMs known to have similar structure. We characterize the uncertainty of
differences with confidence intervals obtained using a parametric distribution
on parameters of a sparse estimator. Sparse penalties enable statistical
guarantees and interpretable models even in high-dimensional and low-sample
settings. Characterizing the distributions of sparse models is inherently
challenging as the penalties produce a biased estimator. Recent work invokes
the sparsity assumptions to effectively remove the bias from a sparse estimator
such as the lasso. These distributions can be used to give confidence intervals
on edges in GGMs, and by extension their differences. However, in the case of
comparing GGMs, these estimators do not make use of any assumed joint structure
among the GGMs. Inspired by priors from brain functional connectivity we derive
the distribution of parameter differences under a joint penalty when parameters
are known to be sparse in the difference. This leads us to introduce the
debiased multi-task fused lasso, whose distribution can be characterized in an
efficient manner. We then show how the debiased lasso and multi-task fused
lasso can be used to obtain confidence intervals on edge differences in GGMs.

irregular network connections that not only demand extra representation efforts

sparsity at various scales for convolutional neural networks, which are channel
wise, kernel wise and intra kernel strided sparsity. This structured sparsity
is very advantageous for direct computational resource savings on embedded

decide the importance of network connections and paths, the proposed method

assigned by computing the misclassification rate with corresponding
connectivity pattern. The pruned network is re-trained to compensate for the
losses due to pruning. While implementing convolutions as matrix products, we
particularly show that intra kernel strided sparsity with a simple constraint
