http://arxiv.org/abs/2102.00102v2,Adaptive Sequential Design for a Single Time-Series,"The current work is motivated by the need for robust statistical methods for
precision medicine; as such, we address the need for statistical methods that
provide actionable inference for a single unit at any point in time. We aim to
learn an optimal, unknown choice of the controlled components of the design in
order to optimize the expected outcome; with that, we adapt the randomization
mechanism for future time-point experiments based on the data collected on the
individual over time. Our results demonstrate that one can learn the optimal
rule based on a single sample, and thereby adjust the design at any point t
with valid inference for the mean target parameter. This work provides several
contributions to the field of statistical precision medicine. First, we define
a general class of averages of conditional causal parameters defined by the
current context for the single unit time-series data. We define a nonparametric
model for the probability distribution of the time-series under few
assumptions, and aim to fully utilize the sequential randomization in the
estimation procedure via the double robust structure of the efficient influence
curve of the proposed target parameter. We present multiple
exploration-exploitation strategies for assigning treatment, and methods for
estimating the optimal rule. Lastly, we present the study of the data-adaptive
inference on the mean under the optimal treatment rule, where the target
parameter adapts over time in response to the observed context of the
individual. Our target parameter is pathwise differentiable with an efficient
influence function that is doubly robust - which makes it easier to estimate
than previously proposed variations. We characterize the limit distribution of
our estimator under a Donsker condition expressed in terms of a notion of
bracketing entropy adapted to martingale settings.","['Ivana Malenica', 'Aurelien Bibaut', 'Mark J. van der Laan']","['math.ST', 'cs.LG', 'stat.ME', 'stat.ML', 'stat.TH']",2021-01-29 22:51:45+00:00
http://arxiv.org/abs/2102.00082v3,Settling the Sharp Reconstruction Thresholds of Random Graph Matching,"This paper studies the problem of recovering the hidden vertex correspondence
between two edge-correlated random graphs. We focus on the Gaussian model where
the two graphs are complete graphs with correlated Gaussian weights and the
Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi model where the two graphs are subsampled from a common
parent Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi graph $\mathcal{G}(n,p)$. For dense graphs with
$p=n^{-o(1)}$, we prove that there exists a sharp threshold, above which one
can correctly match all but a vanishing fraction of vertices and below which
correctly matching any positive fraction is impossible, a phenomenon known as
the ""all-or-nothing"" phase transition. Even more strikingly, in the Gaussian
setting, above the threshold all vertices can be exactly matched with high
probability. In contrast, for sparse Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi graphs with
$p=n^{-\Theta(1)}$, we show that the all-or-nothing phenomenon no longer holds
and we determine the thresholds up to a constant factor. Along the way, we also
derive the sharp threshold for exact recovery, sharpening the existing results
in Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi graphs.
  The proof of the negative results builds upon a tight characterization of the
mutual information based on the truncated second-moment computation and an
""area theorem"" that relates the mutual information to the integral of the
reconstruction error. The positive results follows from a tight analysis of the
maximum likelihood estimator that takes into account the cycle structure of the
induced permutation on the edges.","['Yihong Wu', 'Jiaming Xu', 'Sophie H. Yu']","['math.ST', 'cs.IT', 'math.IT', 'stat.ML', 'stat.TH', '94A15, 62B10, 68Q87, 05C80, 05C60']",2021-01-29 21:49:50+00:00

nonparametric approach to imputation using the kernel ridge regression

estimator is based on a linearization approach which employs the entropy method

http://arxiv.org/abs/2102.00050v3,Sequential prediction under log-loss and misspecification,"We consider the question of sequential prediction under the log-loss in terms
of cumulative regret. Namely, given a hypothesis class of distributions,
learner sequentially predicts the (distribution of the) next letter in sequence
and its performance is compared to the baseline of the best constant predictor
from the hypothesis class. The well-specified case corresponds to an additional
assumption that the data-generating distribution belongs to the hypothesis
class as well. Here we present results in the more general misspecified case.
Due to special properties of the log-loss, the same problem arises in the
context of competitive-optimality in density estimation, and model selection.
For the $d$-dimensional Gaussian location hypothesis class, we show that
cumulative regrets in the well-specified and misspecified cases asymptotically
coincide. In other words, we provide an $o(1)$ characterization of the
distribution-free (or PAC) regret in this case -- the first such result as far
as we know. We recall that the worst-case (or individual-sequence) regret in
this case is larger by an additive constant ${d\over 2} + o(1)$. Surprisingly,
neither the traditional Bayesian estimators, nor the Shtarkov's normalized
maximum likelihood achieve the PAC regret and our estimator requires special
""robustification"" against heavy-tailed data. In addition, we show two general
results for misspecified regret: the existence and uniqueness of the optimal
estimator, and the bound sandwiching the misspecified regret between
well-specified regrets with (asymptotically) close hypotheses classes.","['Meir Feder', 'Yury Polyanskiy']","['cs.LG', 'cs.IT', 'math.IT', 'stat.ML']",2021-01-29 20:28:23+00:00

analytically tractable optimization program, in a quest to better understand
deep neural networks that are trained for a sufficiently long time. As the name
suggests, this new model is derived by isolating the topmost layer from the
remainder of the neural network, followed by imposing certain constraints
separately on the two parts of the network. We demonstrate that the
Layer-Peeled Model, albeit simple, inherits many characteristics of
well-trained neural networks, thereby offering an effective tool for explaining
and predicting common empirical patterns of deep learning training. First, when
working on class-balanced datasets, we prove that any solution to this model
forms a simplex equiangular tight frame, which in part explains the recently
discovered phenomenon of neural collapse \cite{papyan2020prevalence}. More
importantly, when moving to the imbalanced case, our analysis of the
Layer-Peeled Model reveals a hitherto unknown phenomenon that we term
\textit{Minority Collapse}, which fundamentally limits the performance of deep
learning models on the minority classes. In addition, we use the Layer-Peeled
Model to gain insights into how to mitigate Minority Collapse. Interestingly,
this phenomenon is first predicted by the Layer-Peeled Model before being
confirmed by our computational experiments.","['Cong Fang', 'Hangfeng He', 'Qi Long', 'Weijie J. Su']","['cs.LG', 'cs.CV', 'math.OC', 'stat.ML']",2021-01-29 17:37:17+00:00

statistical robustness only considers the effect of small perturbations in

that is aimed at reducing the number of edges in a network. In this work, we
show how even simpler networks can be produced by aggregating the nodes of the
graphical model. We develop a new convex regularized method, called the
tree-aggregated graphical lasso or tag-lasso, that estimates graphical models
that are both edge-sparse and node-aggregated. The aggregation is performed in
a data-driven fashion by leveraging side information in the form of a tree that
encodes node similarity and facilitates the interpretation of the resulting
aggregated nodes. We provide an efficient implementation of the tag-lasso by
using the locally adaptive alternating direction method of multipliers and

of well-known methods for it, including vector auto-regressive models,
state-space methods, multi-task regression, and others. Our focus is on low
rank forecasters, which break forecasting up into two steps: estimating a
vector that can be interpreted as a latent state, given the past, and then
estimating the future values of the time series, given the latent state
estimate. We introduce the concept of forecast consistency, which means that
the estimates of the same value made at different times are consistent. We
formulate the forecasting problem in general form, and focus on linear
forecasters, for which we propose a formulation that can be solved via convex
optimization. We describe a number of extensions and variations, including
nonlinear forecasters, data weighting, the inclusion of auxiliary data, and

functions. We introduce two main tools for estimating the metric entropy,
approximation rates, and $n$-widths of these spaces. First, we introduce the
notion of a smoothly parameterized dictionary and give upper bounds on the
non-linear approximation rates, metric entropy and $n$-widths of their absolute
convex hull. The upper bounds depend upon the order of smoothness of the
parameterization. This result is applied to dictionaries of ridge functions
corresponding to shallow neural networks, and they improve upon existing
results in many cases. Next, we provide a method for lower bounding the metric
entropy and $n$-widths of variation spaces which contain certain classes of
ridge functions. This result gives sharp lower bounds on the
$L^2$-approximation rates, metric entropy, and $n$-widths for variation spaces

approximating probability distributions. We prove that neural networks can
transform a low-dimensional source distribution to a distribution that is
arbitrarily close to a high-dimensional target distribution, when the closeness
are measured by Wasserstein distances and maximum mean discrepancy. Upper
bounds of the approximation error are obtained in terms of the width and depth
of neural network. Furthermore, it is shown that the approximation error in
Wasserstein distance grows at most linearly on the ambient dimension and that
the approximation order only depends on the intrinsic dimension of the target
distribution. On the contrary, when $f$-divergences are used as metrics of
distributions, the approximation property is different. We show that in order
to approximate the target distribution in $f$-divergences, the dimension of the
source distribution cannot be smaller than the intrinsic dimension of the
target distribution.","['Yunfei Yang', 'Zhen Li', 'Yang Wang']","['cs.LG', 'math.PR', 'math.ST', 'stat.ML', 'stat.TH']",2021-01-29 01:45:02+00:00
http://arxiv.org/abs/2101.12288v3,From Geometry to Topology: Inverse Theorems for Distributed Persistence,"What is the ""right"" topological invariant of a large point cloud X? Prior
research has focused on estimating the full persistence diagram of X, a
quantity that is very expensive to compute, unstable to outliers, and far from
a sufficient statistic. We therefore propose that the correct invariant is not
the persistence diagram of X, but rather the collection of persistence diagrams
of many small subsets. This invariant, which we call ""distributed persistence,""
is perfectly parallelizable, more stable to outliers, and has a rich inverse
theory. The map from the space of point clouds (with the quasi-isometry metric)
to the space of distributed persistence invariants (with the
Hausdorff-Bottleneck distance) is a global quasi-isometry. This is a much
stronger property than simply being injective, as it implies that the inverse
of a small neighborhood is a small neighborhood, and is to our knowledge the
only result of its kind in the TDA literature. Moreover, the quasi-isometry
bounds depend on the size of the subsets taken, so that as the size of these
subsets goes from small to large, the invariant interpolates between a purely
geometric one and a topological one. Lastly, we note that our inverse results
do not actually require considering all subsets of a fixed size (an enormous
collection), but a relatively small collection satisfying certain covering
properties that arise with high probability when randomly sampling subsets.
These theoretical results are complemented by two synthetic experiments
demonstrating the use of distributed persistence in practice.","['Elchanan Solomon', 'Alexander Wagner', 'Paul Bendich']","['math.AT', 'cs.LG', 'stat.ML']",2021-01-28 21:36:45+00:00

dimension (a key tuning parameter) that depends on the smoothness of the NPIV
function and the degree of ill-posedness, both are unknown in practice. We next
propose a Lepski-type data-driven choice of the key sieve dimension adaptive to
the unknown NPIV model features. The adaptive estimator of the quadratic
functional is shown to attain the minimax optimal rate in the severely

the federated learning (FL) framework in supervised learning. It is inspired by
practical applications in cognitive radio and recommender systems, and enjoys
features that are analogous to FL. This paper proposes a general framework of
FMAB and then studies two specific federated bandit models. We first study the
approximate model where the heterogeneous local models are random realizations
of the global model from an unknown distribution. This model introduces a new
uncertainty of client sampling, as the global model may not be reliably learned
even if the finite local models are perfectly known. Furthermore, this
uncertainty cannot be quantified a priori without knowledge of the
suboptimality gap. We solve the approximate model by proposing Federated Double
UCB (Fed2-UCB), which constructs a novel ""double UCB"" principle accounting for
uncertainties from both arm and client sampling. We show that gradually
admitting new clients is critical in achieving an O(log(T)) regret while
explicitly considering the communication cost. The exact model, where the
global bandit model is the exact average of heterogeneous local models, is then
studied as a special case. We show that, somewhat surprisingly, the
order-optimal regret can be achieved independent of the number of clients with
a careful choice of the update periodicity. Experiments using both synthetic

the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed algorithms.","['Chengshuai Shi', 'Cong Shen']","['cs.LG', 'cs.IT', 'cs.MA', 'math.IT', 'stat.ML']",2021-01-28 18:59:19+00:00

the path of gradient flow on the full batch loss function. However moderately
large learning rates can achieve higher test accuracies, and this
generalization benefit is not explained by convergence bounds, since the
learning rate which maximizes test accuracy is often larger than the learning
rate which minimizes training loss. To interpret this phenomenon we prove that
for SGD with random shuffling, the mean SGD iterate also stays close to the
path of gradient flow if the learning rate is small and finite, but on a
modified loss. This modified loss is composed of the original loss function and
an implicit regularizer, which penalizes the norms of the minibatch gradients.
Under mild assumptions, when the batch size is small the scale of the implicit
regularization term is proportional to the ratio of the learning rate to the
batch size. We verify empirically that explicitly including the implicit
regularizer in the loss can enhance the test accuracy when the learning rate is
small.","['Samuel L. Smith', 'Benoit Dherin', 'David G. T. Barrett', 'Soham De']","['cs.LG', 'stat.ML']",2021-01-28 18:32:14+00:00

approximations that, for huge sparse feature sets, diminish the theoretical
advantages, must be used. Often, they apply stochastic gradient methods with
hyper-parameters that must be tuned on some surrogate loss, defeating
theoretical advantages of Bayesian methods. The surrogate loss, defined to
approximate the mixture, requires techniques as Monte Carlo sampling,
increasing computations per example. We propose low complexity analytical
approximations for sparse online logistic and probit regressions. Unlike
variational inference and other methods, our methods use analytical closed
forms, substantially lowering computations. Unlike dense solutions, as Gaussian
Mixtures, our methods allow for sparse problems with huge feature sets without
increasing complexity. With the analytical closed forms, there is also no need
for applying stochastic gradient methods on surrogate losses, and for tuning

synthetic data generated by a kinetic Ising model, we confirm that the
algorithm works for restoring missing data points as well as inferring the

inference shows better model-data consistency with observed data points than
with missing data points. As we keep iterating, however, missing data points
show better model-data consistency. We find that demanding equal consistency of
observed and missing data points provides an effective stopping criterion for
the iteration to prevent overshooting the most accurate model inference. Armed
with this EM algorithm with this stopping criterion, we infer missing data
points and an underlying network from a time-series data of real neuronal

series. A common assumption in training neural networks via maximum likelihood
estimation on time series is that the errors across time steps are
uncorrelated. However, errors are actually autocorrelated in many cases due to
the temporality of the data, which makes such maximum likelihood estimations
inaccurate. In this paper, in order to adjust for autocorrelated errors, we
propose to learn the autocorrelation coefficient jointly with the model
parameters. In our experiments, we verify the effectiveness of our approach on
time series forecasting. Results across a wide range of real-world datasets
with various state-of-the-art models show that our method enhances performance
in almost all cases. Based on these results, we suggest empirical critical
values to determine the severity of autocorrelated errors. We also analyze
several aspects of our method to demonstrate its advantages. Finally, other
time series tasks are also considered to validate that our method is not

matching the two feature spaces (i.e., donors and recipients), and requires
estimating transplant outcomes under counterfactual matches not observed in the

learning to predict donor-recipient compatibility; our model learns
representations that cluster donor features, and applies donor-invariant
transformations to recipient features to predict outcomes for a given

of 246 one-class classification problems derived from 50 different real-world
datasets. In addition, we propose a new data descriptor, Average Localised
Proximity (ALP) to address certain issues with existing approaches based on
nearest neighbour distances. Finally, we evaluate classification performance
using a leave-one-dataset-out procedure, and find strong evidence that ALP
outperforms IF and a number of other data descriptors, as well as weak evidence
that it outperforms SVM, making ALP a good default choice.","['Oliver Urs Lenz', 'Daniel Peralta', 'Chris Cornelis']","['cs.LG', 'stat.ML']",2021-01-26 19:14:14+00:00
http://arxiv.org/abs/2101.11020v2,Supervised quantum machine learning models are kernel methods,"With near-term quantum devices available and the race for fault-tolerant
quantum computers in full swing, researchers became interested in the question
of what happens if we replace a supervised machine learning model with a
quantum circuit. While such ""quantum models"" are sometimes called ""quantum
neural networks"", it has been repeatedly noted that their mathematical
structure is actually much more closely related to kernel methods: they analyse
data in high-dimensional Hilbert spaces to which we only have access through
inner products revealed by measurements. This technical manuscript summarises
and extends the idea of systematically rephrasing supervised quantum models as
a kernel method. With this, a lot of near-term and fault-tolerant quantum
models can be replaced by a general support vector machine whose kernel
computes distances between data-encoding quantum states. Kernel-based training
is then guaranteed to find better or equally good quantum models than
variational circuit training. Overall, the kernel perspective of quantum
machine learning tells us that the way that data is encoded into quantum states
is the main ingredient that can potentially set quantum models apart from
classical machine learning models.",['Maria Schuld'],"['quant-ph', 'stat.ML']",2021-01-26 19:00:04+00:00

drugs and find the maximum tolerated dose (MTD). This task becomes
significantly more challenging when multiple-drug dose-combinations (DC) are
involved, due to the inherent conflict between the exponentially increasing DC
candidates and the limited patient budget. This paper proposes a novel Bayesian
design, SDF-Bayes, for finding the MTD for drug combinations in the presence of
safety constraints. Rather than the conventional principle of escalating or
de-escalating the current dose of one drug (perhaps alternating between drugs),
SDF-Bayes proceeds by cautious optimism: it chooses the next DC that, on the
basis of current information, is most likely to be the MTD (optimism), subject
to the constraint that it only chooses DCs that have a high probability of
being safe (caution). We also propose an extension, SDF-Bayes-AR, that accounts
for patient heterogeneity and enables heterogeneous patient recruitment.
Extensive experiments based on both synthetic and real-world datasets
demonstrate the advantages of SDF-Bayes over state of the art DC trial designs
in terms of accuracy and safety.","['Hyun-Suk Lee', 'Cong Shen', 'William Zame', 'Jang-Won Lee', 'Mihaela van der Schaar']","['cs.LG', 'stat.AP', 'stat.ML']",2021-01-26 18:59:26+00:00

in the presence of system noises. In this problem, the system comprises
multiple agents wherein each agent locally observes a set of data points, and
the agents' goal is to compute a linear model that best fits the collective
data points observed by all the agents. We consider a server-based distributed
architecture where the agents interact with a common server to solve the
problem; however, the server cannot access the agents' data points. We consider
a practical scenario wherein the system either has observation noise, i.e., the
data points observed by the agents are corrupted, or has process noise, i.e.,
the computations performed by the server and the agents are corrupted. In
noise-free systems, the recently proposed distributed linear regression
algorithm, named the Iteratively Pre-conditioned Gradient-descent (IPG) method,
has been claimed to converge faster than related methods. In this paper, we
study the robustness of the IPG method, against both the observation noise and

meta-learners have been proposed in recent years. Such learners decompose the
treatment effect estimation problem into separate sub-problems, each solvable

meta-learners in a data-driven manner is difficult, as it requires access to
counterfactual information. Therefore, with the ultimate goal of building
better understanding of the conditions under which some learners can be
expected to perform better than others a priori, we theoretically analyze four
broad meta-learning strategies which rely on plug-in estimation and
pseudo-outcome regression. We highlight how this theoretical reasoning can be
used to guide principled algorithm design and translate our analyses into
practice by considering a variety of neural network architectures as
base-learners for the discussed meta-learning strategies. In a simulation

chi-squared test of independence, or the $G$-test, are typically used for this

their inability to control the size of the test, and their power properties. By
contrast, the USP test is guaranteed to control the size of the test at the
nominal level for all sample sizes, has no issues with small (or zero) cell
counts, and is able to detect distributions that violate independence in only a
minimal way. The test statistic is derived from a $U$-statistic estimator of a
natural population measure of dependence, and we prove that this is the unique
minimum variance unbiased estimator of this population quantity. The practical
utility of the USP test is demonstrated on both simulated data, where its power
can be dramatically greater than those of Pearson's test and the $G$-test, and
on real data. The USP test is implemented in the R package USP.","['Thomas B. Berrett', 'Richard J. Samworth']","['stat.ME', 'math.ST', 'stat.AP', 'stat.ML', 'stat.TH', '62H17, 62H20, 62F03, 62F05, 62E20']",2021-01-26 15:42:44+00:00

case of inpainting and denoising, even when no clean training data is
available. In particular, we show how neural networks can be trained to perform
all of these tasks simultaneously. While, deep autoencoders implemented by way
of neural networks have demonstrated potential for denoising and anomaly
detection, standard autoencoders have the drawback that they require access to
clean data for training. However, recent work in Robust Deep Autoencoders
(RDAEs) shows how autoencoders can be trained to eliminate outliers and noise
in a dataset without access to any clean training data. Inspired by this work,
we extend RDAEs to the case where data are not only noisy and have outliers,
but also only partially observed. Moreover, the dataset we train the neural
network on has the properties that all entries have noise, some entries are
corrupted by large mistakes, and many entries are not even known. Given such an
algorithm, many standard tasks, such as denoising, image inpainting, and
unobserved entry imputation can all be accomplished simultaneously within the
same framework. Herein we demonstrate these techniques on standard machine
learning tasks, such as image inpainting and denoising for the MNIST and
CIFAR10 datasets. However, these approaches are not only applicable to image
processing problems, but also have wide ranging impacts on datasets arising
from real-world problems, such as manufacturing and network processing, where

http://arxiv.org/abs/2101.10832v1,Revisiting Locally Supervised Learning: an Alternative to End-to-end Training,"Due to the need to store the intermediate activations for back-propagation,
end-to-end (E2E) training of deep networks usually suffers from high GPUs
memory footprint. This paper aims to address this problem by revisiting the
locally supervised learning, where a network is split into gradient-isolated
modules and trained with local supervision. We experimentally show that simply
training local modules with E2E loss tends to collapse task-relevant
information at early layers, and hence hurts the performance of the full model.
To avoid this issue, we propose an information propagation (InfoPro) loss,
which encourages local modules to preserve as much useful information as
possible, while progressively discard task-irrelevant information. As InfoPro
loss is difficult to compute in its original form, we derive a feasible upper
bound as a surrogate optimization objective, yielding a simple but effective
algorithm. In fact, we show that the proposed method boils down to minimizing
the combination of a reconstruction loss and a normal cross-entropy/contrastive
term. Extensive empirical results on five datasets (i.e., CIFAR, SVHN, STL-10,
ImageNet and Cityscapes) validate that InfoPro is capable of achieving
competitive performance with less than 40% memory footprint compared to E2E
training, while allowing using training data with higher-resolution or larger
batch sizes under the same GPU memory constraint. Our method also enables
training local modules asynchronously for potential training acceleration. Code

risk prediction models. We evaluate how framing affects model performance and
model learning in four different approaches previously applied in published
artificial-intelligence (AI) models.
  Setting and participants: We analysed structured secondary healthcare data
from 221,283 citizens from four Danish municipalities who were 18 years of age
or older.
  Results: The four models had similar population level performance (a mean
area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.73 to 0.82), in
contrast to the mean average precision, which varied greatly from 0.007 to
0.385. Correspondingly, the percentage of missing values also varied between
framing approaches. The on-clinical-demand framing, which involved samples for
each time the clinicians made an early warning score assessment, showed the
lowest percentage of missing values among the vital sign parameters, and this
model was also able to learn more temporal dependencies than the others. The
Shapley additive explanations demonstrated opposing interpretations of SpO2 in
the prediction of sepsis as a consequence of differentially framed models.
  Conclusions: The profound consequences of framing mandate attention from
clinicians and AI developers, as the understanding and reporting of framing are
pivotal to the successful development and clinical implementation of future AI
technology. Model framing must reflect the expected clinical environment. The
importance of proper problem framing is by no means exclusive to sepsis
prediction and applies to most clinical risk prediction models.","['Simon Meyer Lauritsen', 'Bo Thiesson', 'Marianne Johansson Jørgensen', 'Anders Hammerich Riis', 'Ulrick Skipper Espelund', 'Jesper Bo Weile', 'Jeppe Lange']","['cs.LG', 'cs.AI', 'stat.ML']",2021-01-26 14:00:05+00:00

accurate estimation of treatment effects on time-to-event outcomes in the
presence of time-dependent patient history and time-dependent covariates. To
tackle this longitudinal treatment effect estimation problem, we have developed
a time-variant causal survival (TCS) model that uses the potential outcomes
framework with an ensemble of recurrent subnetworks to estimate the difference
in survival probabilities and its confidence interval over time as a function
of time-dependent covariates and treatments. Using simulated survival datasets,
the TCS model showed good causal effect estimation performance across scenarios
of varying sample dimensions, event rates, confounding and overlapping.
However, increasing the sample size was not effective in alleviating the
adverse impact of a high level of confounding. In a large clinical cohort
study, TCS identified the expected conditional average treatment effect and
detected individual treatment effect heterogeneity over time. TCS provides an
efficient way to estimate and update individualized treatment effects over
time, in order to improve clinical decisions. The use of a propensity score
layer and potential outcome subnetworks helps correcting for selection bias.
However, the proposed model is limited in its ability to correct the bias from
unmeasured confounding, and more extensive testing of TCS under extreme
scenarios such as low overlapping and the presence of unmeasured confounders is
desired and left for future work.","['Jie Zhu', 'Blanca Gallego']","['stat.ML', 'cs.AI', 'cs.LG', 'q-bio.QM']",2021-01-26 09:15:49+00:00

of recurrences, also called analogs. In practice, analogs are nearest
neighbours of the state of a system, taken from a large database called the
catalog. Analogs have been used in many atmospheric applications including
forecasts, downscaling, predictability estimation, and attribution of extreme
events. The distances of the analogs to the target state condition the
performances of analog applications. These distances can be viewed as random
variables, and their probability distributions can be related to the catalog
size and properties of the system at stake. A few studies have focused on the
first moments of return time statistics for the best analog, fixing an
objective of maximum distance from this analog to the target state. However,
for practical use and to reduce estimation variance, applications usually
require not just one, but many analogs. In this paper, we evaluate from a
theoretical standpoint and with numerical experiments the probability
distributions of the $K$-best analog-to-target distances. We show that
dimensionality plays a role on the size of the catalog needed to find good
analogs, and also on the relative means and variances of the $K$-best analogs.

kernel ridge regression (KRR), or as a stylized model for neural networks in

  We define a class of problems satisfying certain spectral conditions on the
underlying kernels, and a hypercontractivity assumption on the associated
eigenfunctions. These conditions are verified by classical high-dimensional

error of random features ridge regression. In particular, we address two
fundamental questions: $(1)$~What is the generalization error of KRR? $(2)$~How
big $N$ should be for the random features approximation to achieve the same
error as KRR?
  In this setting, we prove that KRR is well approximated by a projection onto
the top $\ell$ eigenfunctions of the kernel, where $\ell$ depends on the sample
size $n$. We show that the test error of random features ridge regression is
dominated by its approximation error and is larger than the error of KRR as
long as $N\le n^{1-\delta}$ for some $\delta>0$. We characterize this gap. For
$N\ge n^{1+\delta}$, random features achieve the same error as the
corresponding KRR, and further increasing $N$ does not lead to a significant

training, people usually filter the original data before training the network.
The existing schemes are to treat the filtering and training as two stages, and
the design of the filter requires expert experience, which increases the design
difficulty of the algorithm and is not universal. We note that the essence of
filtering is to filter out the insignificant frequency components and highlight
the important ones, which is similar to the attention mechanism. In this paper,

filtering. We use L1 regularization to further enhance the frequency screening

present a practical framework from a model learning perspective. Based on
black-box model learning with scenario optimisation, we abstract the local
behaviour of a DNN via an affine model with the probably approximately correct
(PAC) guarantee. From the learned model, we can infer the corresponding
PAC-model robustness property. The innovation of our work is the integration of
model learning into PAC robustness analysis: that is, we construct a PAC
guarantee on the model level instead of sample distribution, which induces a
more faithful and accurate robustness evaluation. This is in contrast to
existing statistical methods without model learning. We implement our method in
a prototypical tool named DeepPAC. As a black-box method, DeepPAC is scalable
and efficient, especially when DNNs have complex structures or high-dimensional
inputs. We extensively evaluate DeepPAC, with 4 baselines (using formal
verification, statistical methods, testing and adversarial attack) and 20 DNN
models across 3 datasets, including MNIST, CIFAR-10, and ImageNet. It is shown
that DeepPAC outperforms the state-of-the-art statistical method PROVERO, and
it achieves more practical robustness analysis than the formal verification
tool ERAN. Also, its results are consistent with existing DNN testing work like

standard GSOs that are used in state-of-the-art GNN architectures and the
optimisation of the PGSO parameters is seamlessly included in the model
training. It is proved that the PGSO has real eigenvalues and a set of real
eigenvectors independent of the parameter values and spectral bounds on the
PGSO are derived. PGSO parameters are shown to adapt to the sparsity of the
graph structure in a study on stochastic blockmodel networks, where they are
found to automatically replicate the GSO regularisation found in the

we prove that, with Gaussian kernel, one can set the kernel bandwidth parameter

rate is $N^{-1/(d/2+2)}$ and the eigenvector convergence in 2-norm has rate
$N^{-1/(d+4)}$; When $\epsilon \sim (\log N/N)^{1/(d/2+3)}$, both eigenvalue

to several proposals of regularized variants of OT in the recent literature. In
this work, we consider an \textit{entropy partial transport} (EPT) problem for
nonnegative measures on a tree having different masses. The EPT is shown to be
equivalent to a standard complete OT problem on a one-node extended tree. We
derive its dual formulation, then leverage this to propose a novel
regularization for EPT which admits fast computation and negative definiteness.
To our knowledge, the proposed regularized EPT is the first approach that
yields a \textit{closed-form} solution among available variants of unbalanced
OT. For practical applications without priori knowledge about the tree
structure for measures, we propose tree-sliced variants of the regularized EPT,
computed by averaging the regularized EPT between these measures using random
tree metrics, built adaptively from support data points. Exploiting the
negative definiteness of our regularized EPT, we introduce a positive definite

Instead, we only need to track the evolution of the output at the last hidden

hypergraph clustering. Here, we propose a Poisson degree-corrected hypergraph
stochastic blockmodel (DCHSBM), a generative model of clustered hypergraphs

inference in the DCHSBM naturally leads to a clustering objective that
generalizes the popular modularity objective for graphs. We derive a general

normalizing flows, but log-likelihood is not directly optimized by the weighted
combination of score matching losses. We show that for a specific weighting
scheme, the objective upper bounds the negative log-likelihood, thus enabling
approximate maximum likelihood training of score-based diffusion models. We
empirically observe that maximum likelihood training consistently improves the
likelihood of score-based diffusion models across multiple datasets, stochastic
processes, and model architectures. Our best models achieve negative
log-likelihoods of 2.83 and 3.76 bits/dim on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet 32x32
without any data augmentation, on a par with state-of-the-art autoregressive
models on these tasks.","['Yang Song', 'Conor Durkan', 'Iain Murray', 'Stefano Ermon']","['stat.ML', 'cs.LG']",2021-01-22 18:22:29+00:00
http://arxiv.org/abs/2101.09174v1,Sparsistent filtering of comovement networks from high-dimensional data,"Network filtering is an important form of dimension reduction to isolate the
core constituents of large and interconnected complex systems. We introduce a
new technique to filter large dimensional networks arising out of dynamical
behavior of the constituent nodes, exploiting their spectral properties. As
opposed to the well known network filters that rely on preserving key
topological properties of the realized network, our method treats the spectrum
as the fundamental object and preserves spectral properties. Applying
asymptotic theory for high dimensional data for the filter, we show that it can
be tuned to interpolate between zero filtering to maximal filtering that
induces sparsity and consistency while having the least spectral distance from
a linear shrinkage estimator. We apply our proposed filter to covariance
networks constructed from financial data, to extract the key subnetwork
embedded in the full sample network.","['Arnab Chakrabarti', 'Anindya S. Chakrabarti']","['stat.ML', 'cs.LG']",2021-01-22 15:44:41+00:00
http://arxiv.org/abs/2101.09126v1,Will Artificial Intelligence supersede Earth System and Climate Models?,"We outline a perspective of an entirely new research branch in Earth and
climate sciences, where deep neural networks and Earth system models are
dismantled as individual methodological approaches and reassembled as learning,
self-validating, and interpretable Earth system model-network hybrids.
Following this path, we coin the term ""Neural Earth System Modelling"" (NESYM)
and highlight the necessity of a transdisciplinary discussion platform,
bringing together Earth and climate scientists, big data analysts, and AI
experts. We examine the concurrent potential and pitfalls of Neural Earth
System Modelling and discuss the open question whether artificial intelligence
will not only infuse Earth system modelling, but ultimately render them
obsolete.","['Christopher Irrgang', 'Niklas Boers', 'Maike Sonnewald', 'Elizabeth A. Barnes', 'Christopher Kadow', 'Joanna Staneva', 'Jan Saynisch-Wagner']","['stat.ML', 'cs.LG', 'physics.ao-ph']",2021-01-22 14:33:24+00:00
