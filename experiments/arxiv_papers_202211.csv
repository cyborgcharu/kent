recognition network so that it can model the true posterior distribution
exactly. These results are derived in the general context of probabilistic
graphical modelling / Bayesian networks, for which the network represents a set
of conditional independence statements. We derive both global conditions, in
terms of d-separation, and local conditions for the recognition network to have
the desired qualities. It turns out that for the local conditions the property
perfectness (for every node, all parents are joined) plays an important role.","['Jesse van Oostrum', 'Peter van Hintum', 'Nihat Ay']","['cs.LG', 'cs.AI', 'stat.ML']",2022-12-20 20:56:18+00:00

energy physics builds models that can distinguish between reference and target
datasets, where only the latter has appreciable signal. Such techniques,
including Classification Without Labels (CWoLa) and Simulation Assisted
Likelihood-free Anomaly Detection (SALAD) rely on a single reference dataset.
They cannot take advantage of commonly-available multiple datasets and thus
cannot fully exploit available information. In this work, we propose
generalizations of CWoLa and SALAD for settings where multiple reference
datasets are available, building on weak supervision techniques. We demonstrate
improved performance in a number of settings with realistic and synthetic data.

http://arxiv.org/abs/2212.10538v2,HyperBO+: Pre-training a universal prior for Bayesian optimization with hierarchical Gaussian processes,"Bayesian optimization (BO), while proved highly effective for many black-box
function optimization tasks, requires practitioners to carefully select priors
that well model their functions of interest. Rather than specifying by hand,
researchers have investigated transfer learning based methods to automatically
learn the priors, e.g. multi-task BO (Swersky et al., 2013), few-shot BO
(Wistuba and Grabocka, 2021) and HyperBO (Wang et al., 2022). However, those
prior learning methods typically assume that the input domains are the same for
all tasks, weakening their ability to use observations on functions with
different domains or generalize the learned priors to BO on different search
spaces. In this work, we present HyperBO+: a pre-training approach for
hierarchical Gaussian processes that enables the same prior to work universally
for Bayesian optimization on functions with different domains. We propose a
two-step pre-training method and analyze its appealing asymptotic properties
and benefits to BO both theoretically and empirically. On real-world
hyperparameter tuning tasks that involve multiple search spaces, we demonstrate
that HyperBO+ is able to generalize to unseen search spaces and achieves lower
regrets than competitive baselines.","['Zhou Fan', 'Xinran Han', 'Zi Wang']","['cs.LG', 'stat.ML']",2022-12-20 18:47:10+00:00

is currently often achieved with either Deep-Learning (DL) or
Riemannian-Geometry-based decoders (RBDs). Recently, there is growing interest
in Deep Riemannian Networks (DRNs) possibly combining the advantages of both
previous classes of methods. However, there are still a range of topics where
additional insight is needed to pave the way for a more widespread application
of DRNs in EEG. These include architecture design questions such as network
size and end-to-end ability. How these factors affect model performance has not
been explored. Additionally, it is not clear how the data within these networks
is transformed, and whether this would correlate with traditional EEG decoding.
Our study aims to lay the groundwork in the area of these topics through the
analysis of DRNs for EEG with a wide range of hyperparameters. Networks were
tested on five public EEG datasets and compared with state-of-the-art ConvNets.
  Here we propose EE(G)-SPDNet, and we show that this wide, end-to-end DRN can
outperform the ConvNets, and in doing so use physiologically plausible
frequency regions. We also show that the end-to-end approach learns more
complex filters than traditional band-pass filters targeting the classical
alpha, beta, and gamma frequency bands of the EEG, and that performance can
benefit from channel specific filtering approaches. Additionally, architectural
analysis revealed areas for further improvement due to the possible under
utilisation of Riemannian specific information throughout the network. Our
study thus shows how to design and train DRNs to infer task-related information
from the raw EEG without the need of handcrafted filterbanks and highlights the
potential of end-to-end DRNs such as EE(G)-SPDNet for high-performance EEG
decoding.","['Daniel Wilson', 'Robin Tibor Schirrmeister', 'Lukas Alexander Wilhelm Gemein', 'Tonio Ball']","['cs.LG', 'eess.SP', 'stat.ML']",2022-12-20 17:04:50+00:00

Furthermore, we observe that our proposed approach has improved smoothness and
inherent regularization that make it well-suited for system ID and provide
mathematical explanations for these characteristics' origins. Finally,
numerical simulations demonstrate a mean squared error over 8.7 times lower

combating distributional uncertainty, e.g., the uncertainty of an empirical
distribution compared to the true underlying distribution. This paper
investigates the connections among the three frameworks and, in particular,
explores why these frameworks tend to have smaller generalization errors.
Specifically, first, we suggest a quantitative definition for ""distributional

that Bayesian methods are distributionally robust in the probably approximately
correct (PAC) sense; in addition, by constructing a Dirichlet-process-like

problems based on pairwise comparisons with additional covariate information
such as the attributes of the compared items. Despite extensive studies, few
prior literatures investigate this problem under the more realistic setting
where covariate information exists. To tackle this issue, we propose a novel
model, Covariate-Assisted Ranking Estimation (CARE) model, that extends the
well-known Bradley-Terry-Luce (BTL) model, by incorporating the covariate
information. Specifically, instead of assuming every compared item has a fixed
latent score $\{\theta_i^*\}_{i=1}^n$, we assume the underlying scores are
given by $\{\alpha_i^*+{x}_i^\top\beta^*\}_{i=1}^n$, where $\alpha_i^*$ and
${x}_i^\top\beta^*$ represent latent baseline and covariate score of the $i$-th
item, respectively. We impose natural identifiability conditions and derive the
$\ell_{\infty}$- and $\ell_2$-optimal rates for the maximum likelihood
estimator of $\{\alpha_i^*\}_{i=1}^{n}$ and $\beta^*$ under a sparse comparison
graph, using a novel `leave-one-out' technique (Chen et al., 2019) . To conduct
statistical inferences, we further derive asymptotic distributions for the MLE
of $\{\alpha_i^*\}_{i=1}^n$ and $\beta^*$ with minimal sample complexity. This
allows us to answer the question whether some covariates have any explanation
power for latent scores and to threshold some sparse parameters to improve the
ranking performance. We improve the approximation method used in (Gao et al.,
2021) for the BLT model and generalize it to the CARE model. Moreover, we

observations collected a priori (from either fixed or adaptively evolving
behavior policies) to learn an optimal individualized decision rule that
achieves the best overall outcomes for a given population. Existing policy
learning methods rely on a uniform overlap assumption, i.e., the propensities
of exploring all actions for all individual characteristics must be lower
bounded. As one has no control over the data collection process, this
assumption can be unrealistic in many situations, especially when the behavior
policies are allowed to evolve over time with diminishing propensities for
certain actions.
  In this paper, we propose Pessimistic Policy Learning (PPL), a new algorithm
that optimizes lower confidence bounds (LCBs) -- instead of point estimates --
of the policy values. The LCBs are constructed using knowledge of the behavior
policies for collecting the offline data. Without assuming any uniform overlap
condition, we establish a data-dependent upper bound for the suboptimality of
our algorithm, which only depends on (i) the overlap for the optimal policy,
and (ii) the complexity of the policy class we optimize over. As an
implication, for adaptively collected data, we ensure efficient policy learning
as long as the propensities for optimal actions are lower bounded over time,
while those for suboptimal ones are allowed to diminish arbitrarily fast. In
our theoretical analysis, we develop a new self-normalized type concentration
inequality for inverse-propensity-weighting estimators, generalizing the
well-known empirical Bernstein's inequality to unbounded and non-i.i.d. data.

in biomedicine. To improve efficiency, these techniques may employ landmark
samplers. The heuristic maxmin procedure obtains a roughly even distribution of
sample points by implicitly constructing a cover comprising sets of uniform
radius. However, issues arise with data that vary in density or include points
with multiplicities, as are common in biomedicine. We propose an analogous
procedure, ""lastfirst"" based on ranked distances, which implies a cover
comprising sets of uniform cardinality. We first rigorously define the
procedure and prove that it obtains landmarks with desired properties. We then
perform benchmark tests and compare its performance to that of maxmin, on
feature detection and class prediction tasks involving simulated and real-world
biomedical data. Lastfirst is more general than maxmin in that it can be
applied to any data on which arbitrary (and not necessarily symmetric) pairwise
distances can be computed. Lastfirst is more computationally costly, but our
implementation scales at the same rate as maxmin. We find that lastfirst

Most existing TTA approaches assume the setting in which the target domain is

However, in many practical settings, the test input distribution might exhibit
a lifelong/continual shift over time. Moreover, existing TTA approaches also
lack the ability to provide reliable uncertainty estimates, which is crucial
when distribution shifts occur between the source and target domain. To address
these issues, we present PETAL (Probabilistic lifElong Test-time Adaptation

approach, and naturally results in (1) a student-teacher framework, where the
teacher model is an exponential moving average of the student model, and (2)
regularizing the model updates at inference time using the source model as a

unbiased substructure that can achieve better out-of-distribution (OOD)
generalization than the original model. Existing works usually search the
invariant subnetwork using modular risk minimization (MRM) with out-domain
data. Such a paradigm may bring about two potential weaknesses: 1) Unfairness,
due to the insufficient observation of out-domain data during training; and 2)
Sub-optimal OOD generalization, due to the feature-untargeted model pruning on
the whole data distribution. In this paper, we propose a novel Spurious
Feature-targeted model Pruning framework, dubbed SFP, to automatically explore
invariant substructures without referring to the above weaknesses.
Specifically, SFP identifies in-distribution (ID) features during training
using our theoretically verified task loss, upon which, SFP can perform ID
targeted-model pruning that removes branches with strong dependencies on ID
features. Notably, by attenuating the projections of spurious features into
model space, SFP can push the model learning toward invariant features and pull
that out of environmental features, devising optimal OOD generalization.
Moreover, we also conduct detailed theoretical analysis to provide the
rationality guarantee and a proof framework for OOD structures via model
sparsity, and for the first time, reveal how a highly biased data distribution
affects the model's OOD generalization. Extensive experiments on various OOD
datasets show that SFP can significantly outperform both structure-based and

nested features or representations with certain spectral properties). As a
result, the understanding of the cost of representation learning in contextual

than linear bandits (i.e., learning with a given representation). In
particular, learning with a given set of representations is never simpler than
learning with the worst realizable representation in the set, while we show
cases where it can be arbitrarily harder. We complement this result with an

significant attention in recent years due to its affordable complexity compared

baseline algorithm for solving nonconvex optimization problems. The success of
GD has been witnessed in many different problems in both theory and practice
when it is combined with random initialization. However, previous works on
matrix completion require either careful initialization or regularizers to
prove the convergence of GD. In this work, we study the rank-1 symmetric matrix
completion and prove that GD converges to the ground truth when small random
initialization is used. We show that in logarithmic amount of iterations, the
trajectory enters the region where local convergence occurs. We provide an
upper bound on the initialization size that is sufficient to guarantee the
convergence and show that a larger initialization can be used as more samples
are available. We observe that implicit regularization effect of GD plays a
critical role in the analysis, and for the entire trajectory, it prevents each

contrast between the high and the low risk policy holders, and indeed improve
upon the actual risk estimation performed by the insurer. Due to the visual

from a library of physics-based functions is proposed. The sparse Bayesian
machine learning is used to update and derive an interpretable expression for
the digital twin. Two approaches for updating the digital twin are proposed.
The first approach makes use of both the input and output information from a
dynamical system, whereas the second approach utilizes output-only observations
to update the digital twin. Both methods use a library of candidate functions
representing certain physics to infer new perturbation terms in the existing
digital twin model. In both cases, the resulting expressions of updated digital
twins are identical, and in addition, the epistemic uncertainties are
quantified. In the first approach, the regression problem is derived from a
state-space model, whereas in the latter case, the output-only information is
treated as a stochastic process. The concepts of It\^o calculus and
Kramers-Moyal expansion are being utilized to derive the regression equation.
The performance of the proposed approaches is demonstrated using highly
nonlinear dynamical systems such as the crack-degradation problem. Numerical
results demonstrated in this paper almost exactly identify the correct
perturbation terms along with their associated parameters in the dynamical
system. The probabilistic nature of the proposed approach also helps in
quantifying the uncertainties associated with updated models. The proposed
approaches provide an exact and explainable description of the perturbations in

strategy to choose the regularization parameter and show the adaptive test to
be almost minimax optimal up to a logarithmic factor. Moreover, our results

practice, one often resorts to using permutation testing, which provides a
nonasymptotic guarantee at the expense of recalculating the quadratic-time

nontrivial modification of HSIC and dCov (called xHSIC and xdCov, pronounced

variational autoencoder (VAE). In our TTS method, we use a waveform model based
on VAE, a diffusion model that predicts the distribution of latent variables in
the waveform model from texts, and an alignment model that learns alignments
between the text and speech latent sequences. Our method integrates diffusion
with VAE by modeling both mean and variance parameters with diffusion, where
the target distribution is determined by approximation from VAE. This latent
variable conversion framework potentially enables us to flexibly incorporate
various latent feature extractors. Our experiments show that our method is

Moreover, it can facilitate the NN-based hypothesis testing that can be applied

distance-based classifiers such as nearest class mean. In this work, we
introduce a Gaussian model of the feature distribution. By estimating the
parameters of this model, we are able to predict the generalization error on
new classification tasks with few samples. We observe that accurate distance
estimates between class-conditional densities are the key to accurate estimates
of the generalization performance. Therefore, we propose an unbiased estimator
for these distances and integrate it in our numerical analysis. We empirically

of deep learning models in real-world applications. In the case of regression
tasks, prediction intervals (PIs) should be provided along with the
deterministic predictions of deep learning models. Such PIs are useful or
""high-quality"" as long as they are sufficiently narrow and capture most of the
probability density. In this paper, we present a method to learn prediction
intervals for regression-based neural networks automatically in addition to the
conventional target predictions. In particular, we train two companion neural
networks: one that uses one output, the target estimate, and another that uses
two outputs, the upper and lower bounds of the corresponding PI. Our main
contribution is the design of a novel loss function for the PI-generation
network that takes into account the output of the target-estimation network and
has two optimization objectives: minimizing the mean prediction interval width
and ensuring the PI integrity using constraints that maximize the prediction
interval probability coverage implicitly. Furthermore, we introduce a
self-adaptive coefficient that balances both objectives within the loss
function, which alleviates the task of fine-tuning. Experiments using a
synthetic dataset, eight benchmark datasets, and a real-world crop yield
prediction dataset showed that our method was able to maintain a nominal
probability coverage and produce significantly narrower PIs without detriment
to its target estimation accuracy when compared to those PIs generated by three

learning models and tasks, which works for information fusion and structured
data (like sets and graphs) representation. However, without solid mathematical
fundamentals, its practical implementations often depend on empirical
mechanisms and thus lead to sub-optimal, even unsatisfactory performance. In
this work, we develop a novel and generalized global pooling framework through
the lens of optimal transport. The proposed framework is interpretable from the
perspective of expectation-maximization. Essentially, it aims at learning an
optimal transport across sample indices and feature dimensions, making the
corresponding pooling operation maximize the conditional expectation of input
data. We demonstrate that most existing pooling methods are equivalent to
solving a regularized optimal transport (ROT) problem with different
specializations, and more sophisticated pooling operations can be implemented
by hierarchically solving multiple ROT problems. Making the parameters of the
ROT problem learnable, we develop a family of regularized optimal transport
pooling (ROTP) layers. We implement the ROTP layers as a new kind of deep
implicit layer. Their model architectures correspond to different optimization
algorithms. We test our ROTP layers in several representative set-level machine
learning scenarios, including multi-instance learning (MIL), graph
classification, graph set representation, and image classification.
Experimental results show that applying our ROTP layers can reduce the
difficulty of the design and selection of global pooling -- our ROTP layers may
either imitate some existing global pooling methods or lead to some new pooling
layers fitting data better. The code is available at

permissible threshold. In contrast to standard tail risk measures and
distributionally robust losses that require the specification of a plausible
magnitude of distribution shift, the stability measure is defined in terms of a
more intuitive quantity: the level of acceptable performance degradation. We
develop a minimax optimal estimator of stability and analyze its convergence
rate, which exhibits a fundamental phase shift behavior. Our characterization
of the minimax convergence rate shows that evaluating stability against large
performance degradation incurs a statistical cost. Empirically, we demonstrate
the practical utility of our stability framework by using it to compare system

numerical experiment to deblur an image that the convergence behavior in the
logarithmic-scale ordinate tends to be linear instead of logarithmic,
approximating to be flat. Making meticulous observations, we find that the
previous assumption for the smooth part to be convex weakens the least-square
model. Specifically, assuming the smooth part to be strongly convex is more
reasonable for the least-square model, even though the image matrix is probably
ill-conditioned. Furthermore, we improve the pivotal inequality tighter for
composite optimization with the smooth part to be strongly convex instead of
general convex, which is first found in [Li et al., 2022]. Based on this
pivotal inequality, we generalize the linear convergence to composite
optimization in both the objective value and the squared proximal subgradient

compute the singular values instead of the original blur matrix. The new
numerical experiment shows the proximal generalization of Nesterov's

of independent interest and works by iteratively solving weighted MLEs over
variance-altered versions of the GLM objective. SVAM offers provable model
recovery guarantees superior to the state-of-the-art for robust regression even
when a constant fraction of training labels are adversarially corrupted. SVAM
also empirically outperforms several existing problem-specific techniques for
robust regression and classification. Code for SVAM is available at

http://arxiv.org/abs/2212.05427v1,Statistical guarantees for sparse deep learning,"Neural networks are becoming increasingly popular in applications, but our
mathematical understanding of their potential and limitations is still limited.
In this paper, we further this understanding by developing statistical
guarantees for sparse deep learning. In contrast to previous work, we consider
different types of sparsity, such as few active connections, few active nodes,
and other norm-based types of sparsity. Moreover, our theories cover important
aspects that previous theories have neglected, such as multiple outputs,
regularization, and l2-loss. The guarantees have a mild dependence on network
widths and depths, which means that they support the application of sparse but
wide and deep networks from a statistical perspective. Some of the concepts and
tools that we use in our derivations are uncommon in deep learning and, hence,
might be of additional interest.",['Johannes Lederer'],"['cs.LG', 'cs.AI', 'math.ST', 'stat.ML', 'stat.TH']",2022-12-11 06:45:45+00:00
http://arxiv.org/abs/2212.05378v1,Neural Continuous-Time Markov Models,"Continuous-time Markov chains are used to model stochastic systems where
transitions can occur at irregular times, e.g., birth-death processes, chemical
reaction networks, population dynamics, and gene regulatory networks. We
develop a method to learn a continuous-time Markov chain's transition rate
functions from fully observed time series. In contrast with existing methods,
our method allows for transition rates to depend nonlinearly on both state
variables and external covariates. The Gillespie algorithm is used to generate
trajectories of stochastic systems where propensity functions (reaction rates)
are known. Our method can be viewed as the inverse: given trajectories of a
stochastic reaction network, we generate estimates of the propensity functions.
While previous methods used linear or log-linear methods to link transition
rates to covariates, we use neural networks, increasing the capacity and
potential accuracy of learned models. In the chemical context, this enables the
method to learn propensity functions from non-mass-action kinetics. We test our
method with synthetic data generated from a variety of systems with known
transition rates. We show that our method learns these transition rates with
considerably more accuracy than log-linear methods, in terms of mean absolute
error between ground truth and predicted transition rates. We also demonstrate
an application of our methods to open-loop control of a continuous-time Markov
chain.","['Majerle Reeves', 'Harish S. Bhat']","['stat.ML', 'cs.LG', 'cs.SY', 'eess.SY']",2022-12-11 00:07:41+00:00
http://arxiv.org/abs/2212.05149v1,Stochastic Optimization for Spectral Risk Measures,"Spectral risk objectives - also called $L$-risks - allow for learning systems
to interpolate between optimizing average-case performance (as in empirical
risk minimization) and worst-case performance on a task. We develop stochastic
algorithms to optimize these quantities by characterizing their subdifferential
and addressing challenges such as biasedness of subgradient estimates and
non-smoothness of the objective. We show theoretically and experimentally that
out-of-the-box approaches such as stochastic subgradient and dual averaging are
hindered by bias and that our approach outperforms them.","['Ronak Mehta', 'Vincent Roulet', 'Krishna Pillutla', 'Lang Liu', 'Zaid Harchaoui']","['stat.ML', 'cs.LG', 'math.OC']",2022-12-10 00:03:12+00:00
http://arxiv.org/abs/2212.05015v3,Robustness Implies Privacy in Statistical Estimation,"We study the relationship between adversarial robustness and differential
privacy in high-dimensional algorithmic statistics. We give the first black-box
reduction from privacy to robustness which can produce private estimators with
optimal tradeoffs among sample complexity, accuracy, and privacy for a wide
range of fundamental high-dimensional parameter estimation problems, including
mean and covariance estimation. We show that this reduction can be implemented
in polynomial time in some important special cases. In particular, using
nearly-optimal polynomial-time robust estimators for the mean and covariance of
high-dimensional Gaussians which are based on the Sum-of-Squares method, we
design the first polynomial-time private estimators for these problems with
nearly-optimal samples-accuracy-privacy tradeoffs. Our algorithms are also
robust to a nearly optimal fraction of adversarially-corrupted samples.","['Samuel B. Hopkins', 'Gautam Kamath', 'Mahbod Majid', 'Shyam Narayanan']","['cs.DS', 'cs.CR', 'cs.IT', 'math.IT', 'stat.ML']",2022-12-09 18:07:30+00:00
http://arxiv.org/abs/2212.04955v2,Simulating first-order phase transition with hierarchical autoregressive networks,"We apply the Hierarchical Autoregressive Neural (HAN) network sampling
algorithm to the two-dimensional $Q$-state Potts model and perform simulations
around the phase transition at $Q=12$. We quantify the performance of the
approach in the vicinity of the first-order phase transition and compare it
with that of the Wolff cluster algorithm. We find a significant improvement as
far as the statistical uncertainty is concerned at a similar numerical effort.
In order to efficiently train large neural networks we introduce the technique
of pre-training. It allows to train some neural networks using smaller system
sizes and then employing them as starting configurations for larger system
sizes. This is possible due to the recursive construction of our hierarchical
approach. Our results serve as a demonstration of the performance of the
hierarchical approach for systems exhibiting bimodal distributions.
Additionally, we provide estimates of the free energy and entropy in the
vicinity of the phase transition with statistical uncertainties of the order of
$10^{-7}$ for the former and $10^{-3}$ for the latter based on a statistics of
$10^6$ configurations.","['Piotr Białas', 'Paulina Czarnota', 'Piotr Korcyl', 'Tomasz Stebel']","['cond-mat.stat-mech', 'cond-mat.dis-nn', 'hep-lat', 'stat.ML']",2022-12-09 16:04:56+00:00
