http://arxiv.org/abs/2106.15013v4,Small random initialization is akin to spectral learning: Optimization and generalization guarantees for overparameterized low-rank matrix reconstruction,"Recently there has been significant theoretical progress on understanding the
convergence and generalization of gradient-based methods on nonconvex losses
with overparameterized models. Nevertheless, many aspects of optimization and
generalization and in particular the critical role of small random
initialization are not fully understood. In this paper, we take a step towards
demystifying this role by proving that small random initialization followed by
a few iterations of gradient descent behaves akin to popular spectral methods.
We also show that this implicit spectral bias from small random initialization,
which is provably more prominent for overparameterized models, also puts the
gradient descent iterations on a particular trajectory towards solutions that
are not only globally optimal but also generalize well. Concretely, we focus on
the problem of reconstructing a low-rank matrix from a few measurements via a
natural nonconvex formulation. In this setting, we show that the trajectory of
the gradient descent iterations from small random initialization can be
approximately decomposed into three phases: (I) a spectral or alignment phase
where we show that that the iterates have an implicit spectral bias akin to
spectral initialization allowing us to show that at the end of this phase the
column space of the iterates and the underlying low-rank matrix are
sufficiently aligned, (II) a saddle avoidance/refinement phase where we show
that the trajectory of the gradient iterates moves away from certain degenerate
saddle points, and (III) a local refinement phase where we show that after
avoiding the saddles the iterates converge quickly to the underlying low-rank
matrix. Underlying our analysis are insights for the analysis of
overparameterized nonconvex optimization schemes that may have implications for
computational problems beyond low-rank reconstruction.","['Dominik Stöger', 'Mahdi Soltanolkotabi']","['cs.LG', 'cs.IT', 'math.IT', 'math.OC', 'math.ST', 'stat.ML', 'stat.TH']",2021-06-28 22:52:39+00:00

$L^2(\Omega)$ for a bounded domain $\Omega\subset \mathbb{R}^d$. Specifically,
we compare the variation space, which is defined in terms of a convex hull with
related notions based on integral representations. This allows us to show that
three important notions relating to the approximation theory of shallow neural
networks, the Barron space, the spectral Barron space, and the Radon BV space,

http://arxiv.org/abs/2106.14999v1,Test-Time Adaptation to Distribution Shift by Confidence Maximization and Input Transformation,"Deep neural networks often exhibit poor performance on data that is unlikely
under the train-time data distribution, for instance data affected by
corruptions. Previous works demonstrate that test-time adaptation to data
shift, for instance using entropy minimization, effectively improves
performance on such shifted distributions. This paper focuses on the fully
test-time adaptation setting, where only unlabeled data from the target
distribution is required. This allows adapting arbitrary pretrained networks.
Specifically, we propose a novel loss that improves test-time adaptation by
addressing both premature convergence and instability of entropy minimization.
This is achieved by replacing the entropy by a non-saturating surrogate and
adding a diversity regularizer based on batch-wise entropy maximization that
prevents convergence to trivial collapsed solutions. Moreover, we propose to
prepend an input transformation module to the network that can partially undo
test-time distribution shifts. Surprisingly, this preprocessing can be learned
solely using the fully test-time adaptation loss in an end-to-end fashion
without any target domain labels or source domain data. We show that our
approach outperforms previous work in improving the robustness of publicly
available pretrained image classifiers to common corruptions on such
challenging benchmarks as ImageNet-C.","['Chaithanya Kumar Mummadi', 'Robin Hutmacher', 'Kilian Rambach', 'Evgeny Levinkov', 'Thomas Brox', 'Jan Hendrik Metzen']","['stat.ML', 'cs.LG']",2021-06-28 22:06:10+00:00
http://arxiv.org/abs/2106.14997v2,Sharp Lower Bounds on the Approximation Rate of Shallow Neural Networks,"We consider the approximation rates of shallow neural networks with respect
to the variation norm. Upper bounds on these rates have been established for
sigmoidal and ReLU activation functions, but it has remained an important open
problem whether these rates are sharp. In this article, we provide a solution
to this problem by proving sharp lower bounds on the approximation rates for
shallow neural networks, which are obtained by lower bounding the $L^2$-metric
entropy of the convex hull of the neural network basis functions. In addition,
our methods also give sharp lower bounds on the Kolmogorov $n$-widths of this
convex hull, which show that the variation spaces corresponding to shallow
neural networks cannot be efficiently approximated by linear methods. These
lower bounds apply to both sigmoidal activation functions with bounded
variation and to activation functions which are a power of the ReLU. Our
results also quantify how much stronger the Barron spectral norm is than the
variation norm and, combined with previous results, give the asymptotics of the
$L^\infty$-metric entropy up to logarithmic factors in the case of the ReLU
activation function.","['Jonathan W. Siegel', 'Jinchao Xu']","['stat.ML', 'cs.LG', 'math.ST', 'stat.TH', '62M45, 41A46']",2021-06-28 22:01:42+00:00
http://arxiv.org/abs/2106.14993v3,Modularity in Reinforcement Learning via Algorithmic Independence in Credit Assignment,"Many transfer problems require re-using previously optimal decisions for
solving new tasks, which suggests the need for learning algorithms that can
modify the mechanisms for choosing certain actions independently of those for
choosing others. However, there is currently no formalism nor theory for how to
achieve this kind of modular credit assignment. To answer this question, we
define modular credit assignment as a constraint on minimizing the algorithmic
mutual information among feedback signals for different decisions. We introduce
what we call the modularity criterion for testing whether a learning algorithm
satisfies this constraint by performing causal analysis on the algorithm
itself. We generalize the recently proposed societal decision-making framework
as a more granular formalism than the Markov decision process to prove that for
decision sequences that do not contain cycles, certain single-step temporal
difference action-value methods meet this criterion while all policy-gradient
methods do not. Empirical evidence suggests that such action-value methods are
more sample efficient than policy-gradient methods on transfer problems that
require only sparse changes to a sequence of previously optimal decisions.","['Michael Chang', 'Sidhant Kaushik', 'Sergey Levine', 'Thomas L. Griffiths']","['cs.LG', 'cs.AI', 'cs.IT', 'cs.NE', 'math.IT', 'stat.ML']",2021-06-28 21:29:13+00:00

http://arxiv.org/abs/2106.14979v3,On component interactions in two-stage recommender systems,"Thanks to their scalability, two-stage recommenders are used by many of
today's largest online platforms, including YouTube, LinkedIn, and Pinterest.
These systems produce recommendations in two steps: (i) multiple nominators,
tuned for low prediction latency, preselect a small subset of candidates from
the whole item pool; (ii) a slower but more accurate ranker further narrows
down the nominated items, and serves to the user. Despite their popularity, the
literature on two-stage recommenders is relatively scarce, and the algorithms
are often treated as mere sums of their parts. Such treatment presupposes that
the two-stage performance is explained by the behavior of the individual
components in isolation. This is not the case: using synthetic and real-world
data, we demonstrate that interactions between the ranker and the nominators
substantially affect the overall performance. Motivated by these findings, we
derive a generalization lower bound which shows that independent nominator
training can lead to performance on par with uniformly random recommendations.
We find that careful design of item pools, each assigned to a different
nominator, alleviates these issues. As manual search for a good pool allocation
is difficult, we propose to learn one instead using a Mixture-of-Experts based
approach. This significantly improves both precision and recall at K.","['Jiri Hron', 'Karl Krauth', 'Michael I. Jordan', 'Niki Kilbertus']","['cs.IR', 'cs.LG', 'stat.ML']",2021-06-28 20:53:23+00:00

We model each agent's state over time as a two-state Markov chain that

no restrictions on the maximum number of Byzantine agents at any given time. We
design our method based on three layers of defense: 1) temporal robust
aggregation, 2) spatial robust aggregation, and 3) gradient normalization. We
study two settings for stochastic optimization, namely Sample Average

solve a wide variety of tasks. If tasks depend on each other (e.g. needing to
learn to walk before learning to run), curriculum learning can speed up
learning by focusing on the next best task to learn. We explore curriculum
learning in a complex, visual domain with many hard exploration challenges:
Minecraft. We find that learning progress (defined as a change in success
probability of a task) is a reliable measure of learnability for automatically
constructing an effective curriculum. We introduce a learning-progress based
curriculum and test it on a complex reinforcement learning problem (called
""Simon Says"") where an agent is instructed to obtain a desired goal item. Many
of the required skills depend on each other. Experiments demonstrate that: (1)
a within-episode exploration bonus for obtaining new items improves
performance, (2) dynamically adjusting this bonus across training such that it
only applies to items the agent cannot reliably obtain yet further increases
performance, (3) the learning-progress based curriculum elegantly follows the
learning curve of the agent, and (4) when the learning-progress based
curriculum is combined with the dynamic exploration bonus it learns much more
efficiently and obtains far higher performance than uniform baselines. These
results suggest that combining intra-episode and across-training exploration
bonuses with learning progress creates a promising method for automated
curriculum generation, which may substantially increase our ability to train
more capable, generally intelligent agents.","['Ingmar Kanitscheider', 'Joost Huizinga', 'David Farhi', 'William Hebgen Guss', 'Brandon Houghton', 'Raul Sampedro', 'Peter Zhokhov', 'Bowen Baker', 'Adrien Ecoffet', 'Jie Tang', 'Oleg Klimov', 'Jeff Clune']","['cs.LG', 'stat.ML']",2021-06-28 17:50:40+00:00

multi-armed bandit instance from observing the learning process of a low-regret
demonstrator. Existing approaches to the related problem of inverse
reinforcement learning assume the execution of an optimal policy, and thereby
suffer from an identifiability issue. In contrast, we propose to leverage the
demonstrator's behavior en route to optimality, and in particular, the
exploration phase, for reward estimation. We begin by establishing a general
information-theoretic lower bound under this paradigm that applies to any
demonstrator algorithm, which characterizes a fundamental tradeoff between
reward estimation and the amount of exploration of the demonstrator. Then, we
develop simple and efficient reward estimators for upper-confidence-based
demonstrator algorithms that attain the optimal tradeoff, showing in particular
that consistent reward estimation -- free of identifiability issues -- is
possible under our paradigm. Extensive simulations on both synthetic and
semi-synthetic data corroborate our theoretical results.","['Wenshuo Guo', 'Kumar Krishna Agrawal', 'Aditya Grover', 'Vidya Muthukumar', 'Ashwin Pananjady']","['stat.ML', 'cs.AI', 'cs.IT', 'cs.LG', 'cs.RO', 'math.IT']",2021-06-28 17:37:49+00:00

http://arxiv.org/abs/2106.14836v4,Understanding Dynamics of Nonlinear Representation Learning and Its Application,"Representations of the world environment play a crucial role in artificial
intelligence. It is often inefficient to conduct reasoning and inference
directly in the space of raw sensory representations, such as pixel values of
images. Representation learning allows us to automatically discover suitable
representations from raw sensory data. For example, given raw sensory data, a
deep neural network learns nonlinear representations at its hidden layers,
which are subsequently used for classification (or regression) at its output
layer. This happens implicitly during training through minimizing a supervised
or unsupervised loss in common practical regimes of deep learning, unlike the
neural tangent kernel (NTK) regime. In this paper, we study the dynamics of
such implicit nonlinear representation learning, which is beyond the NTK
regime. We identify a pair of a new assumption and a novel condition, called
the common model structure assumption and the data-architecture alignment
condition. Under the common model structure assumption, the data-architecture
alignment condition is shown to be sufficient for the global convergence and
necessary for the global optimality. Moreover, our theory explains how and when
increasing the network size does and does not improve the training behaviors in
the practical regime. Our results provide practical guidance for designing a
model structure: e.g., the common model structure assumption can be used as a
justification for using a particular model structure instead of others. We also
derive a new training framework based on the theory. The proposed framework is
empirically shown to maintain competitive (practical) test performances while
providing global convergence guarantees for deep residual neural networks with
convolutions, skip connections, and batch normalization with standard benchmark
datasets, including CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and SVHN.","['Kenji Kawaguchi', 'Linjun Zhang', 'Zhun Deng']","['cs.LG', 'cs.CV', 'math.OC', 'stat.ML']",2021-06-28 16:31:30+00:00
http://arxiv.org/abs/2106.14813v2,Offline Planning and Online Learning under Recovering Rewards,"Motivated by emerging applications such as live-streaming e-commerce,
promotions and recommendations, we introduce and solve a general class of
non-stationary multi-armed bandit problems that have the following two
features: (i) the decision maker can pull and collect rewards from up to
$K\,(\ge 1)$ out of $N$ different arms in each time period; (ii) the expected
reward of an arm immediately drops after it is pulled, and then
non-parametrically recovers as the arm's idle time increases. With the
objective of maximizing the expected cumulative reward over $T$ time periods,
we design a class of ``Purely Periodic Policies'' that jointly set a period to
pull each arm. For the proposed policies, we prove performance guarantees for
both the offline problem and the online problems. For the offline problem when
all model parameters are known, the proposed periodic policy obtains an
approximation ratio that is at the order of $1-\mathcal O(1/\sqrt{K})$, which
is asymptotically optimal when $K$ grows to infinity. For the online problem
when the model parameters are unknown and need to be dynamically learned, we
integrate the offline periodic policy with the upper confidence bound procedure
to construct on online policy. The proposed online policy is proved to
approximately have $\widetilde{\mathcal O}(N\sqrt{T})$ regret against the
offline benchmark. Our framework and policy design may shed light on broader
offline planning and online learning applications with non-stationary and
recovering rewards.","['David Simchi-Levi', 'Zeyu Zheng', 'Feng Zhu']","['stat.ML', 'cs.DM', 'cs.LG', 'math.OC']",2021-06-28 15:40:07+00:00

theoretical properties and offer practical functional benefits, such as
improved predictive uncertainty quantification and model selection. The Laplace
approximation (LA) is a classic, and arguably the simplest family of
approximations for the intractable posteriors of deep neural networks. Yet,
despite its simplicity, the LA is not as popular as alternatives like
variational Bayes or deep ensembles. This may be due to assumptions that the LA
is expensive due to the involved Hessian computation, that it is difficult to
implement, or that it yields inferior results. In this work we show that these
are misconceptions: we (i) review the range of variants of the LA including
versions with minimal cost overhead; (ii) introduce ""laplace"", an easy-to-use
software library for PyTorch offering user-friendly access to all major flavors
of the LA; and (iii) demonstrate through extensive experiments that the LA is
competitive with more popular alternatives in terms of performance, while
excelling in terms of computational cost. We hope that this work will serve as

Intelligence (AI) errors. These corrections should be quick and non-iterative.
To solve this problem without modification of a legacy AI system, we propose
special `external' devices, correctors. Elementary correctors consist of two
parts, a classifier that separates the situations with high risk of error from
the situations in which the legacy AI system works well and a new decision for
situations with potential errors. Input signals for the correctors can be the
inputs of the legacy AI system, its internal signals, and outputs. If the
intrinsic dimensionality of data is high enough then the classifiers for
correction of small number of errors can be very simple. According to the
blessing of dimensionality effects, even simple and robust Fisher's
discriminants can be used for one-shot learning of AI correctors. Stochastic
separation theorems provide the mathematical basis for this one-short learning.
However, as the number of correctors needed grows, the cluster structure of
data becomes important and a new family of stochastic separation theorems is
required. We refuse the classical hypothesis of the regularity of the data
distribution and assume that the data can have a fine-grained structure with
many clusters and peaks in the probability density. New stochastic separation
theorems for data with fine-grained structure are formulated and proved. The
multi-correctors for granular data are proposed. The advantages of the
multi-corrector technology were demonstrated by examples of correcting errors

state-of-the-art deep networks while using significantly less memory. Yet they
are also slower, brittle to architectural choices, and introduce potential
instability to the model. In this paper, we propose a regularization scheme for
DEQ models that explicitly regularizes the Jacobian of the fixed-point update
equations to stabilize the learning of equilibrium models. We show that this
regularization adds only minimal computational cost, significantly stabilizes
the fixed-point convergence in both forward and backward passes, and scales
well to high-dimensional, realistic domains (e.g., WikiText-103 language
modeling and ImageNet classification). Using this method, we demonstrate, for
the first time, an implicit-depth model that runs with approximately the same
speed and level of performance as popular conventional deep networks such as
ResNet-101, while still maintaining the constant memory footprint and
architectural simplicity of DEQs. Code is available at

Deterministic MDPs can be interpreted as graphs and analyzed in terms of their

exemplify this result on a deterministic line search problem, and a
deterministic MDP with state-dependent rewards, whose regret lower bounds we

computer-simulations, it is important to account for the variability in the
ensemble of objects to be imaged. This source of variability can be described
by stochastic object models (SOMs). It is generally desirable to establish SOMs
from experimental imaging measurements acquired by use of a well-characterized
imaging system, but this task has remained challenging. Approach: A generative
adversarial network (GAN)-based method that employs AmbientGANs with modern
progressive or multiresolution training approaches is proposed. AmbientGANs
established using the proposed training procedure are systematically validated
in a controlled way using computer-simulated magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)
data corresponding to a stylized imaging system. Emulated single-coil
experimental MRI data are also employed to demonstrate the methods under less
stylized conditions. Results: The proposed AmbientGAN method can generate clean
images when the imaging measurements are contaminated by measurement noise.
When the imaging measurement data are incomplete, the proposed AmbientGAN can
reliably learn the distribution of the measurement components of the objects.
Conclusions: Both visual examinations and quantitative analyses, including
task-specific validations using the Hotelling observer, demonstrated that the
proposed AmbientGAN method holds promise to establish realistic SOMs from
imaging measurements.","['Weimin Zhou', 'Sayantan Bhadra', 'Frank J. Brooks', 'Hua Li', 'Mark A. Anastasio']","['eess.IV', 'cs.CV', 'cs.LG', 'stat.ML']",2021-06-27 21:46:23+00:00

\frac{1}{2}\|\mathbf{U}\mathbf{V}^\top -\mathbf{\Sigma}\|_F^2\] where
$\mathbf{\Sigma}$ is a given matrix of size $m \times n$ and rank $d$. This is
a canonical problem that admits two difficulties in optimization: 1)
non-convexity and 2) non-smoothness (due to unbalancedness of $\mathbf{U}$ and
$\mathbf{V}$). This is also a prototype for more complex problems such as
asymmetric matrix sensing and matrix completion. Despite being non-convex and
non-smooth, it has been observed empirically that the randomly initialized
gradient descent algorithm can solve this problem in polynomial time. Existing
theories to explain this phenomenon all require artificial modifications of the

special kernel $K$ a pseudo-differential operator $p({\mathbf x}, D)$ such that
$\mathcal{F} p({\mathbf x}, D)^\dag p({\mathbf x}, D) \mathcal{F}^{-1}$ acts on
smooth functions in the same way as an integral operator associated with $K$

pseudo-differential operators are able to approximate uniformly any continuous
Mercer kernel on a compact set.
  The symbol $p({\mathbf x}, {\mathbf y})$ encapsulates a lot of useful
information about the structure of the Maximum Mean Discrepancy distance
defined by the kernel $K$. We approximate $p({\mathbf x}, {\mathbf y})$ with
the sum of the first $r$ terms of the Singular Value Decomposition of $p$,
denoted by $p_r({\mathbf x}, {\mathbf y})$. If ordered singular values of the
integral operator associated with $p({\mathbf x}, {\mathbf y})$ die down
rapidly, the MMD distance defined by the new symbol $p_r$ differs from the
initial one only slightly. Moreover, the new MMD distance can be interpreted as
an aggregated result of comparing $r$ local moments of two probability
distributions.
  The latter results holds under the condition that right singular vectors of
the integral operator associated with $p$ are uniformly bounded. But even if
this is not satisfied we can still hold that the Hilbert-Schmidt distance
between $p$ and $p_r$ vanishes. Thus, we report an interesting phenomenon: the
MMD distance measures the difference of two probability distributions with

Gaussian processes (GP) stand out as easy-to-use and interpretable learners,
they have difficulties in accommodating big datasets, categorical inputs, and
multiple responses, which has become a common challenge for a growing number of
data-driven design applications. In this paper, we propose a GP model that
utilizes latent variables and functions obtained through variational inference
to address the aforementioned challenges simultaneously. The method is built
upon the latent variable Gaussian process (LVGP) model where categorical
factors are mapped into a continuous latent space to enable GP modeling of
mixed-variable datasets. By extending variational inference to LVGP models, the
large training dataset is replaced by a small set of inducing points to address
the scalability issue. Output response vectors are represented by a linear
combination of independent latent functions, forming a flexible kernel
structure to handle multiple responses that might have distinct behaviors.
Comparative studies demonstrate that the proposed method scales well for large
datasets with over 10^4 data points, while outperforming state-of-the-art
machine learning methods without requiring much hyperparameter tuning. In
addition, an interpretable latent space is obtained to draw insights into the

prediction to decide whether to call the high-fidelity model, and for enhanced
subsequent accuracy, adapting the correction for the LF prediction after every
HF model call. The framework does not make any assumptions as to the LF model
type or its correlations with the HF model. In addition, for improved
robustness when estimating smaller failure probabilities, we propose using
dynamic active learning functions that decide when to call the HF model. We
demonstrate our framework using several academic case studies and two finite
element (FE) model case studies: estimating Navier-Stokes velocities using the
Stokes approximation and estimating stresses in a transversely isotropic model
subjected to displacements via a coarsely meshed isotropic model. Across these
case studies, not only did the proposed framework estimate the failure
probabilities accurately, but compared with either Monte Carlo or a standard
variance reduction method, it also required only a small fraction of the calls
to the HF model.","['S. L. N. Dhulipala', 'M. D. Shields', 'B. W. Spencer', 'C. Bolisetti', 'A. E. Slaughter', 'V. M. Laboure', 'P. Chakroborty']","['stat.ML', 'cs.LG', 'stat.AP']",2021-06-25 17:44:28+00:00
http://arxiv.org/abs/2106.13781v1,Tighter Analysis of Alternating Stochastic Gradient Method for Stochastic Nested Problems,"Stochastic nested optimization, including stochastic compositional, min-max
and bilevel optimization, is gaining popularity in many machine learning
applications. While the three problems share the nested structure, existing
works often treat them separately, and thus develop problem-specific algorithms
and their analyses. Among various exciting developments, simple SGD-type
updates (potentially on multiple variables) are still prevalent in solving this
class of nested problems, but they are believed to have slower convergence rate
compared to that of the non-nested problems. This paper unifies several
SGD-type updates for stochastic nested problems into a single SGD approach that
we term ALternating Stochastic gradient dEscenT (ALSET) method. By leveraging
the hidden smoothness of the problem, this paper presents a tighter analysis of
ALSET for stochastic nested problems. Under the new analysis, to achieve an
$\epsilon$-stationary point of the nested problem, it requires ${\cal
O}(\epsilon^{-2})$ samples. Under certain regularity conditions, applying our
results to stochastic compositional, min-max and reinforcement learning
problems either improves or matches the best-known sample complexity in the
respective cases. Our results explain why simple SGD-type algorithms in
stochastic nested problems all work very well in practice without the need for
further modifications.","['Tianyi Chen', 'Yuejiao Sun', 'Wotao Yin']","['stat.ML', 'cs.LG', 'math.OC']",2021-06-25 17:33:51+00:00

mechanism for incorporating inductive biases into VAEs, and introduce a simple
and effective alternative approach: Intermediary Latent Space VAEs(InteL-VAEs).
InteL-VAEs use an intermediary set of latent variables to control the
stochasticity of the encoding process, before mapping these in turn to the
latent representation using a parametric function that encapsulates our desired
inductive bias(es). This allows us to impose properties like sparsity or
clustering on learned representations, and incorporate human knowledge into the
generative model. Whereas changing the prior only indirectly encourages
behavior through regularizing the encoder, InteL-VAEs are able to directly
enforce desired characteristics. Moreover, they bypass the computation and
encoder design issues caused by non-Gaussian priors, while allowing for
additional flexibility through training of the parametric mapping function. We
show that these advantages, in turn, lead to both better generative models and
better representations being learned.","['Ning Miao', 'Emile Mathieu', 'N. Siddharth', 'Yee Whye Teh', 'Tom Rainforth']","['stat.ML', 'cs.LG']",2021-06-25 16:34:05+00:00

loadings simultaneously. To achieve these goals, we employ a non-convex
truncated regularization with naturally adjustable sparsity and grouping
effects, and propose the Feature Grouping and Sparse Principal Component
Analysis (FGSPCA). The proposed FGSPCA method encourages the factor loadings
with similar values to collapse into disjoint homogeneous groups for feature
grouping or into a special zero-valued group for feature selection, which in
turn helps reducing model complexity and increasing model interpretation.
Usually, existing structured PCA methods require prior knowledge to construct
the regularization term. However, the proposed FGSPCA can simultaneously
capture the grouping and/or sparse structures of factor loadings without any
prior information. To solve the resulting non-convex optimization problem, we
propose an alternating algorithm that incorporates the difference-of-convex
programming, augmented Lagrange method and coordinate descent method.
Experimental results demonstrate the promising performance and efficiency of
the new method on both synthetic and real-world datasets. An R implementation

risk prediction models translate family histories into cancer risk predictions

in clinical practice to help identify high-risk individuals. Mendelian models
leverage the entire family history, but they rely on many assumptions about
cancer susceptibility genes that are either unrealistic or challenging to
validate due to low mutation prevalence. Training more flexible models, such as
neural networks, on large databases of pedigrees can potentially lead to
accuracy gains. In this paper, we develop a framework to apply neural networks

In data simulated under Mendelian inheritance, we demonstrate that our proposed
neural network models are able to achieve nearly optimal prediction
performance. Moreover, when the observed family history includes misreported
cancer diagnoses, neural networks are able to outperform the Mendelian BRCAPRO

similar values around multiple centers instead of just around 0. Compared with
existing algorithms, the proposed GRMF can automatically learn the grouping
structure and sparsity in MF without prior knowledge, by introducing a
naturally adjustable non-convex regularization to achieve simultaneous sparsity

minimization framework to perform MF, in which the original non-convex problem
is first converted into a convex problem through Difference-of-Convex (DC)

(ADMM). In addition, GRMF can be easily extended to the Non-negative Matrix

learning models in different domains. For graph-level tasks such as graph

domains, multiple local systems, each holding a small set of graphs, may
benefit from collaboratively training a powerful graph mining model, such as
the popular graph neural networks (GNNs). To provide more motivation towards
such endeavors, we analyze real-world graphs from different domains to confirm
that they indeed share certain graph properties that are statistically
significant compared with random graphs. However, we also find that different

clusters of local systems based on the gradients of GNNs, and theoretically
justify that such clusters can reduce the structure and feature heterogeneity

samples from an unknown distribution $p$ over $\{1, \dots, n\}$, is it
$\varepsilon_1$-close to or $\varepsilon_2$-far from a reference distribution
$q$ (in total variation distance)? Despite significant interest over the past
decade, this problem is well understood only in the extreme cases. In the
noiseless setting (i.e., $\varepsilon_1 = 0$) the sample complexity is
$\Theta(\sqrt{n})$, strongly sublinear in the domain size. At the other end of
the spectrum, when $\varepsilon_1 = \varepsilon_2/2$, the sample complexity
jumps to the barely sublinear $\Theta(n/\log n)$. However, very little is known
about the intermediate regime. We fully characterize the price of tolerance in
distribution testing as a function of $n$, $\varepsilon_1$, $\varepsilon_2$, up
to a single $\log n$ factor. Specifically, we show the sample complexity to be
\[\tilde \Theta\left(\frac{\sqrt{n}}{\varepsilon_2^{2}} + \frac{n}{\log n}

\left\{\frac{\varepsilon_1}{\varepsilon_2^2},\left(\frac{\varepsilon_1}{\varepsilon_2^2}\right)^{\!\!2}\right\}\right),\]

provide a similar characterization for the problem of tolerant equivalence
testing, where both $p$ and $q$ are unknown. Surprisingly, in both cases, the
main quantity dictating the sample complexity is the ratio
$\varepsilon_1/\varepsilon_2^2$, and not the more intuitive
$\varepsilon_1/\varepsilon_2$. Of particular technical interest is our lower

variables sampled for prolonged periods of time. For example, in neuroscience,
the activities of 100s-1000's of neurons are recorded during behaviors and in
response to sensory stimuli. Multi-output Gaussian process models leverage the
nonparametric nature of Gaussian processes to capture structure across multiple
outputs. However, this class of models typically assumes that the correlations
between the output response variables are invariant in the input space.
Stochastic linear mixing models (SLMM) assume the mixture coefficients depend
on input, making them more flexible and effective to capture complex output
dependence. However, currently, the inference for SLMMs is intractable for
large datasets, making them inapplicable to several modern time-series
problems. In this paper, we propose a new regression framework, the orthogonal

precision computation (e.g. INT8 rather than FP32), but this comes with a cost
of deteriorating the functional performance (e.g. accuracy) of the model. Some

that is typically applied to problems with a small number of independent
objectives. However, in practice we often wish to optimize objectives defined
over many correlated outcomes (or ""tasks""). For example, scientists may want to
optimize the coverage of a cell tower network across a dense grid of locations.
Similarly, engineers may seek to balance the performance of a robot across
dozens of different environments via constrained or robust optimization.
However, the Gaussian Process (GP) models typically used as probabilistic
surrogates for multi-task Bayesian Optimization scale poorly with the number of
outcomes, greatly limiting applicability. We devise an efficient technique for
exact multi-task GP sampling that combines exploiting Kronecker structure in
the covariance matrices with Matheron's identity, allowing us to perform
Bayesian Optimization using exact multi-task GP models with tens of thousands
of correlated outputs. In doing so, we achieve substantial improvements in
sample efficiency compared to existing approaches that only model aggregate
functions of the outcomes. We demonstrate how this unlocks a new class of
applications for Bayesian Optimization across a range of tasks in science and

unknown signal from repeated measurements of its images under the latent action
of a group of isometries and additive noise of magnitude $\sigma$. Despite
significant interest, a clear picture for understanding rates of estimation in
this model has emerged only recently, particularly in the high-noise regime
$\sigma \gg 1$ that is highly relevant in applications. Recent investigations
have revealed a remarkable asymptotic sample complexity of order $\sigma^6$ for
certain signals whose Fourier transforms have full support, in stark contrast
to the traditional $\sigma^2$ that arise in regular models. Often prohibitively
large in practice, these results have prompted the investigation of variations
around the MRA model where better sample complexity may be achieved. In this
paper, we show that sparse signals exhibit an intermediate $\sigma^4$ sample
complexity even in the classical MRA model. Further, we characterise the
dependence of the estimation rate on the support size $s$ as $O_p(1)$ and
$O_p(s^{3.5})$ in the dilute and moderate regimes of sparsity respectively. Our
techniques have implications for the problem of crystallographic phase
retrieval, indicating a certain local uniqueness for the recovery of sparse
signals from their power spectrum. Our results explore and exploit connections

support vector machines, and deep neural networks, utilize surrogate loss
techniques to circumvent the computational complexity of minimizing empirical
classification risk. These techniques are also useful for causal policy
learning problems, since estimation of individualized treatment rules can be
cast as a weighted (cost-sensitive) classification problem. Consistency of the
surrogate loss approaches studied in Zhang (2004) and Bartlett et al. (2006)
crucially relies on the assumption of correct specification, meaning that the
specified set of classifiers is rich enough to contain a first-best classifier.
This assumption is, however, less credible when the set of classifiers is
constrained by interpretability or fairness, leaving the applicability of
surrogate loss based algorithms unknown in such second-best scenarios. This
paper studies consistency of surrogate loss procedures under a constrained set
of classifiers without assuming correct specification. We show that in the
setting where the constraint restricts the classifier's prediction set only,
hinge losses (i.e., $\ell_1$-support vector machines) are the only surrogate
losses that preserve consistency in second-best scenarios. If the constraint
additionally restricts the functional form of the classifier, consistency of a
surrogate loss approach is not guaranteed even with hinge loss. We therefore
characterize conditions for the constrained set of classifiers that can
guarantee consistency of hinge risk minimizing classifiers. Exploiting our
theoretical results, we develop robust and computationally attractive hinge

http://arxiv.org/abs/2106.12498v1,Universal Consistency of Deep Convolutional Neural Networks,"Compared with avid research activities of deep convolutional neural networks
(DCNNs) in practice, the study of theoretical behaviors of DCNNs lags heavily
behind. In particular, the universal consistency of DCNNs remains open. In this
paper, we prove that implementing empirical risk minimization on DCNNs with
expansive convolution (with zero-padding) is strongly universally consistent.
Motivated by the universal consistency, we conduct a series of experiments to
show that without any fully connected layers, DCNNs with expansive convolution
perform not worse than the widely used deep neural networks with hybrid
structure containing contracting (without zero-padding) convolution layers and
several fully connected layers.","['Shao-Bo Lin', 'Kaidong Wang', 'Yao Wang', 'Ding-Xuan Zhou']","['cs.LG', 'cs.IT', 'math.IT', 'stat.ML']",2021-06-23 16:17:21+00:00
http://arxiv.org/abs/2106.12491v1,Training Data Subset Selection for Regression with Controlled Generalization Error,"Data subset selection from a large number of training instances has been a
successful approach toward efficient and cost-effective machine learning.
However, models trained on a smaller subset may show poor generalization
ability. In this paper, our goal is to design an algorithm for selecting a
subset of the training data, so that the model can be trained quickly, without
significantly sacrificing on accuracy. More specifically, we focus on data
subset selection for L2 regularized regression problems and provide a novel
problem formulation which seeks to minimize the training loss with respect to
both the trainable parameters and the subset of training data, subject to error
bounds on the validation set. We tackle this problem using several technical
innovations. First, we represent this problem with simplified constraints using
the dual of the original training problem and show that the objective of this
new representation is a monotone and alpha-submodular function, for a wide
variety of modeling choices. Such properties lead us to develop SELCON, an
efficient majorization-minimization algorithm for data subset selection, that
admits an approximation guarantee even when the training provides an imperfect
estimate of the trained model. Finally, our experiments on several datasets
show that SELCON trades off accuracy and efficiency more effectively than the
current state-of-the-art.","['Durga Sivasubramanian', 'Rishabh Iyer', 'Ganesh Ramakrishnan', 'Abir De']","['cs.LG', 'stat.ML']",2021-06-23 16:03:55+00:00
http://arxiv.org/abs/2106.12423v4,Alias-Free Generative Adversarial Networks,"We observe that despite their hierarchical convolutional nature, the
synthesis process of typical generative adversarial networks depends on
absolute pixel coordinates in an unhealthy manner. This manifests itself as,
e.g., detail appearing to be glued to image coordinates instead of the surfaces
of depicted objects. We trace the root cause to careless signal processing that
causes aliasing in the generator network. Interpreting all signals in the
network as continuous, we derive generally applicable, small architectural
changes that guarantee that unwanted information cannot leak into the
hierarchical synthesis process. The resulting networks match the FID of
StyleGAN2 but differ dramatically in their internal representations, and they
are fully equivariant to translation and rotation even at subpixel scales. Our
results pave the way for generative models better suited for video and
animation.","['Tero Karras', 'Miika Aittala', 'Samuli Laine', 'Erik Härkönen', 'Janne Hellsten', 'Jaakko Lehtinen', 'Timo Aila']","['cs.CV', 'cs.AI', 'cs.LG', 'cs.NE', 'stat.ML']",2021-06-23 14:20:01+00:00

http://arxiv.org/abs/2106.12408v4,The SKIM-FA Kernel: High-Dimensional Variable Selection and Nonlinear Interaction Discovery in Linear Time,"Many scientific problems require identifying a small set of covariates that
are associated with a target response and estimating their effects. Often,
these effects are nonlinear and include interactions, so linear and additive
methods can lead to poor estimation and variable selection. Unfortunately,
methods that simultaneously express sparsity, nonlinearity, and interactions
are computationally intractable -- with runtime at least quadratic in the
number of covariates, and often worse. In the present work, we solve this
computational bottleneck. We show that suitable interaction models have a
kernel representation, namely there exists a ""kernel trick"" to perform variable
selection and estimation in $O$(# covariates) time. Our resulting fit
corresponds to a sparse orthogonal decomposition of the regression function in
a Hilbert space (i.e., a functional ANOVA decomposition), where interaction
effects represent all variation that cannot be explained by lower-order
effects. On a variety of synthetic and real data sets, our approach outperforms
existing methods used for large, high-dimensional data sets while remaining
competitive (or being orders of magnitude faster) in runtime.","['Raj Agrawal', 'Tamara Broderick']","['stat.CO', 'stat.ME', 'stat.ML']",2021-06-23 13:53:36+00:00

identically distributed random variables with which the original time series
has a causal representation. The innovation at a time is statistically
independent of the history of the time series. As such, it represents the new
information contained at present but not in the past. Because of its simple
probability structure, an innovations sequence is the most efficient signature
of the original. Unlike the principle or independent component analysis
representations, an innovations sequence preserves not only the complete
statistical properties but also the temporal order of the original time series.
An long-standing open problem is to find a computationally tractable way to
extract an innovations sequence of non-Gaussian processes. This paper presents
a deep learning approach, referred to as Innovations Autoencoder (IAE), that
extracts innovations sequences using a causal convolutional neural network. An
application of IAE to the one-class anomalous sequence detection problem with
unknown anomaly and anomaly-free models is also presented.","['Xinyi Wang', 'Lang Tong']","['stat.ML', 'cs.LG']",2021-06-23 13:24:17+00:00

and the Poisson Lee-Carter model on multiple populations. We develop some
neural networks that replicate the structure of the individual LC models and
allow their joint fitting by analysing the mortality data of all the considered
populations simultaneously. The neural network architecture is specifically
designed to calibrate each individual model using all available information
instead of using a population-specific subset of data as in the traditional
estimation schemes. A large set of numerical experiments performed on all the
countries of the Human Mortality Database (HMD) shows the effectiveness of our
approach. In particular, the resulting parameter estimates appear smooth and
less sensitive to the random fluctuations often present in the mortality rates'
data, especially for low-population countries. In addition, the forecasting
performance results significantly improved as well.",['Salvatore Scognamiglio'],"['stat.ML', 'cs.LG']",2021-06-23 11:20:44+00:00
http://arxiv.org/abs/2106.12307v2,Should You Go Deeper? Optimizing Convolutional Neural Network Architectures without Training by Receptive Field Analysis,"When optimizing convolutional neural networks (CNN) for a specific
image-based task, specialists commonly overshoot the number of convolutional
layers in their designs. By implication, these CNNs are unnecessarily resource
intensive to train and deploy, with diminishing beneficial effects on the
predictive performance.
  The features a convolutional layer can process are strictly limited by its
receptive field. By layer-wise analyzing the size of the receptive fields, we
can reliably predict sequences of layers that will not contribute qualitatively
to the test accuracy in the given CNN architecture. Based on this analysis, we
propose design strategies based on a so-called border layer. This layer allows
to identify unproductive convolutional layers and hence to resolve these
inefficiencies, optimize the explainability and the computational performance
of CNNs. Since neither the strategies nor the analysis requires training of the
actual model, these insights allow for a very efficient design process of CNN
architectures, which might be automated in the future.","['Mats L. Richter', 'Julius Schöning', 'Anna Wiedenroth', 'Ulf Krumnack']","['cs.LG', 'cs.AI', 'cs.NE', 'stat.ML']",2021-06-23 11:04:16+00:00
http://arxiv.org/abs/2106.12248v3,ADAVI: Automatic Dual Amortized Variational Inference Applied To Pyramidal Bayesian Models,"Frequently, population studies feature pyramidally-organized data represented
using Hierarchical Bayesian Models (HBM) enriched with plates. These models can
become prohibitively large in settings such as neuroimaging, where a sample is
composed of a functional MRI signal measured on 300 brain locations, across 4
measurement sessions, and 30 subjects, resulting in around 1 million latent
parameters.Such high dimensionality hampers the usage of modern, expressive
flow-based techniques.To infer parameter posterior distributions in this
challenging class of problems, we designed a novel methodology that
automatically produces a variational family dual to a target HBM. This
variational family, represented as a neural network, consists in the
combination of an attention-based hierarchical encoder feeding summary
statistics to a set of normalizing flows. Our automatically-derived neural
network exploits exchangeability in the plate-enriched HBM and factorizes its
parameter space. The resulting architecture reduces by orders of magnitude its
parameterization with respect to that of a typical flow-based representation,
while maintaining expressivity.Our method performs inference on the specified
HBM in an amortized setup: once trained, it can readily be applied to a new
data sample to compute the parameters' full posterior.We demonstrate the
capability and scalability of our method on simulated data, as well as a
challenging high-dimensional brain parcellation experiment. We also open up
several questions that lie at the intersection between normalizing flows, SBI,
structured Variational Inference, and inference amortization.","['Louis Rouillard', 'Demian Wassermann']","['cs.LG', 'cs.AI', 'q-bio.NC', 'stat.ML']",2021-06-23 09:09:01+00:00

stochastic sensitive and non-sensitive contexts. The setting is a repeated game
between the Player and Nature, where at each stage both pick actions based on
the contexts. Inspired by the notion of unawareness, we assume that the Player
can only access the non-sensitive context before making a decision, while we
discuss both cases of Nature accessing the sensitive contexts and Nature
unaware of the sensitive contexts. Adapting Blackwell's approachability theory
to handle the case of an unknown contexts' distribution, we provide a general
necessary and sufficient condition for learning objectives to be compatible
with some fairness constraints. This condition is instantiated on (group-wise)
no-regret and (group-wise) calibration objectives, and on demographic parity as
an additional constraint. When the objective is not compatible with the
constraint, the provided framework permits to characterise the optimal
trade-off between the two.","['Evgenii Chzhen', 'Christophe Giraud', 'Gilles Stoltz']","['cs.LG', 'cs.AI', 'cs.CY', 'stat.ML']",2021-06-23 09:00:12+00:00
