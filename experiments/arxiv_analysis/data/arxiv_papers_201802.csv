http://arxiv.org/abs/1803.06407v1,Deep Component Analysis via Alternating Direction Neural Networks,"Despite a lack of theoretical understanding, deep neural networks have
achieved unparalleled performance in a wide range of applications. On the other
hand, shallow representation learning with component analysis is associated
with rich intuition and theory, but smaller capacity often limits its
usefulness. To bridge this gap, we introduce Deep Component Analysis (DeepCA),
an expressive multilayer model formulation that enforces hierarchical structure
through constraints on latent variables in each layer. For inference, we
propose a differentiable optimization algorithm implemented using recurrent
Alternating Direction Neural Networks (ADNNs) that enable parameter learning
using standard backpropagation. By interpreting feed-forward networks as
single-iteration approximations of inference in our model, we provide both a
novel theoretical perspective for understanding them and a practical technique
for constraining predictions with prior knowledge. Experimentally, we
demonstrate performance improvements on a variety of tasks, including
single-image depth prediction with sparse output constraints.","['Calvin Murdock', 'Ming-Fang Chang', 'Simon Lucey']","['cs.LG', 'cs.CV', 'stat.ML']",2018-03-16 21:40:02+00:00
http://arxiv.org/abs/1803.06401v1,Evaluating Conditional Cash Transfer Policies with Machine Learning Methods,"This paper presents an out-of-sample prediction comparison between major
machine learning models and the structural econometric model. Over the past
decade, machine learning has established itself as a powerful tool in many
prediction applications, but this approach is still not widely adopted in
empirical economic studies. To evaluate the benefits of this approach, I use
the most common machine learning algorithms, CART, C4.5, LASSO, random forest,
and adaboost, to construct prediction models for a cash transfer experiment
conducted by the Progresa program in Mexico, and I compare the prediction
results with those of a previous structural econometric study. Two prediction
tasks are performed in this paper: the out-of-sample forecast and the long-term
within-sample simulation. For the out-of-sample forecast, both the mean
absolute error and the root mean square error of the school attendance rates
found by all machine learning models are smaller than those found by the
structural model. Random forest and adaboost have the highest accuracy for the
individual outcomes of all subgroups. For the long-term within-sample
simulation, the structural model has better performance than do all of the
machine learning models. The poor within-sample fitness of the machine learning
model results from the inaccuracy of the income and pregnancy prediction
models. The result shows that the machine learning model performs better than
does the structural model when there are many data to learn; however, when the
data are limited, the structural model offers a more sensible prediction. The
findings of this paper show promise for adopting machine learning in economic
policy analyses in the era of big data.",['Tzai-Shuen Chen'],"['econ.EM', 'stat.ML']",2018-03-16 21:14:02+00:00
http://arxiv.org/abs/1803.06396v4,Reviving and Improving Recurrent Back-Propagation,"In this paper, we revisit the recurrent back-propagation (RBP) algorithm,
discuss the conditions under which it applies as well as how to satisfy them in
deep neural networks. We show that RBP can be unstable and propose two variants
based on conjugate gradient on the normal equations (CG-RBP) and Neumann series
(Neumann-RBP). We further investigate the relationship between Neumann-RBP and
back propagation through time (BPTT) and its truncated version (TBPTT). Our
Neumann-RBP has the same time complexity as TBPTT but only requires constant
memory, whereas TBPTT's memory cost scales linearly with the number of
truncation steps. We examine all RBP variants along with BPTT and TBPTT in
three different application domains: associative memory with continuous
Hopfield networks, document classification in citation networks using graph
neural networks and hyperparameter optimization for fully connected networks.
All experiments demonstrate that RBPs, especially the Neumann-RBP variant, are
efficient and effective for optimizing convergent recurrent neural networks.

http://arxiv.org/abs/1803.06386v1,Forecasting Economics and Financial Time Series: ARIMA vs. LSTM,"Forecasting time series data is an important subject in economics, business,
and finance. Traditionally, there are several techniques to effectively
forecast the next lag of time series data such as univariate Autoregressive
(AR), univariate Moving Average (MA), Simple Exponential Smoothing (SES), and
more notably Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) with its many
variations. In particular, ARIMA model has demonstrated its outperformance in
precision and accuracy of predicting the next lags of time series. With the
recent advancement in computational power of computers and more importantly
developing more advanced machine learning algorithms and approaches such as
deep learning, new algorithms are developed to forecast time series data. The
research question investigated in this article is that whether and how the
newly developed deep learning-based algorithms for forecasting time series
data, such as ""Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)"", are superior to the traditional
algorithms. The empirical studies conducted and reported in this article show
that deep learning-based algorithms such as LSTM outperform traditional-based
algorithms such as ARIMA model. More specifically, the average reduction in
error rates obtained by LSTM is between 84 - 87 percent when compared to ARIMA
indicating the superiority of LSTM to ARIMA. Furthermore, it was noticed that
the number of training times, known as ""epoch"" in deep learning, has no effect
on the performance of the trained forecast model and it exhibits a truly random
behavior.","['Sima Siami-Namini', 'Akbar Siami Namin']","['cs.LG', 'q-fin.ST', 'stat.ML']",2018-03-16 20:01:48+00:00

adversarial examples at scale. First, we implement the state of the art version
of adversarial training at unprecedented scale on ImageNet and investigate
whether it remains effective in this setting - an important open scientific
question (Athalye et al., 2018). Next, we introduce enhanced defenses using a
technique we call logit pairing, a method that encourages logits for pairs of
examples to be similar. When applied to clean examples and their adversarial
counterparts, logit pairing improves accuracy on adversarial examples over
vanilla adversarial training; we also find that logit pairing on clean examples
only is competitive with adversarial training in terms of accuracy on two
datasets. Finally, we show that adversarial logit pairing achieves the state of
the art defense on ImageNet against PGD white box attacks, with an accuracy
improvement from 1.5% to 27.9%. Adversarial logit pairing also successfully
damages the current state of the art defense against black box attacks on
ImageNet (Tramer et al., 2018), dropping its accuracy from 66.6% to 47.1%. With
this new accuracy drop, adversarial logit pairing ties with Tramer et al.(2018)

existing systems take approaches which lead to inconsistent estimates. We show

introduce a new online nested Monte Carlo estimator that makes it substantially
easier to ensure these conditions are met, thereby providing a simple framework
for designing statistically correct inference engines. We prove the correctness

http://arxiv.org/abs/1803.06321v1,A particle-based variational approach to Bayesian Non-negative Matrix Factorization,"Bayesian Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) is a promising approach for
understanding uncertainty and structure in matrix data. However, a large volume
of applied work optimizes traditional non-Bayesian NMF objectives that fail to
provide a principled understanding of the non-identifiability inherent in NMF--
an issue ideally addressed by a Bayesian approach. Despite their suitability,
current Bayesian NMF approaches have failed to gain popularity in an applied
setting; they sacrifice flexibility in modeling for tractable computation, tend
to get stuck in local modes, and require many thousands of samples for
meaningful uncertainty estimates. We address these issues through a
particle-based variational approach to Bayesian NMF that only requires the
joint likelihood to be differentiable for tractability, uses a novel
initialization technique to identify multiple modes in the posterior, and
allows domain experts to inspect a `small' set of factorizations that
faithfully represent the posterior. We introduce and employ a class of
likelihood and prior distributions for NMF that formulate a Bayesian model
using popular non-Bayesian NMF objectives. On several real datasets, we obtain
better particle approximations to the Bayesian NMF posterior in less time than
baselines and demonstrate the significant role that multimodality plays in
NMF-related tasks.","['M. Arjumand Masood', 'Finale Doshi-Velez']",['stat.ML'],2018-03-16 17:20:19+00:00

partial permutations, which plays an important role for the problem of matching
multiple objects (e.g. images or shapes). The term synchronisation refers to
the property that the set of pairwise matchings is cycle-consistent, i.e. in
the full matching case all compositions of pairwise matchings over cycles must
be equal to the identity. Motivated by clustering and matrix factorisation
perspectives of cycle-consistency, we derive an algorithm to tackle the
permutation synchronisation problem based on non-negative factorisations. In
order to deal with the inherent non-convexity of the permutation
synchronisation problem, we use an initialisation procedure based on a novel
rotation scheme applied to the solution of the spectral relaxation. Moreover,
this rotation scheme facilitates a convenient Euclidean projection to obtain a
binary solution after solving our relaxed problem. In contrast to
state-of-the-art methods, our approach is guaranteed to produce
cycle-consistent results. We experimentally demonstrate the efficacy of our
method and show that it achieves better results compared to existing methods.","['Florian Bernard', 'Johan Thunberg', 'Jorge Goncalves', 'Christian Theobalt']","['cs.CV', 'math.OC', 'stat.ML']",2018-03-16 17:17:05+00:00

shared facilities (roads, cafeterias, etc.), to support coordination between
them, and increase efficiency of such collective systems. Key questions are:
(1) when and how much can (accurate) predictions help for coordination, and (2)
which assistant algorithms reach optimal predictions?
  First we lay conceptual ground for this setting where user preferences are a

conditions under which self-fulfilling prophecies, i.e., ""perfect""
(probabilistic) predictions of what will happen, solve the coordination problem

Next we prove that such prophecies exist even in large-scale settings where
only aggregated statistics about users are available. This entails a new
(nonatomic) BNE existence result. Addressing (2), we propose two assistant
algorithms that sequentially learn from users' reactions, together with
optimality/convergence guarantees. We validate one of them in a large

Distinct classification outputs are associated with different RG fixed points

understanding data augmentation. We approach this from two directions: First,
we provide a general model of augmentation as a Markov process, and show that
kernels appear naturally with respect to this model, even when we do not employ
kernel classification. Next, we analyze more directly the effect of
augmentation on kernel classifiers, showing that data augmentation can be
approximated by first-order feature averaging and second-order variance
regularization components. These frameworks both serve to illustrate the ways
in which data augmentation affects the downstream learning model, and the
resulting analyses provide novel connections between prior work in invariant
kernels, tangent propagation, and robust optimization. Finally, we provide
several proof-of-concept applications showing that our theory can be useful for
accelerating machine learning workflows, such as reducing the amount of
computation needed to train using augmented data, and predicting the utility of
a transformation prior to training.","['Tri Dao', 'Albert Gu', 'Alexander J. Ratner', 'Virginia Smith', 'Christopher De Sa', 'Christopher Ré']","['cs.LG', 'stat.ML']",2018-03-16 06:05:32+00:00

research interest in performing DNN-related computation efficiently. However,
the primary focus is usually very narrow and limited to (i) inference -- i.e.
how to efficiently execute already trained models and (ii) image classification
networks as the primary benchmark for evaluation.
  Our primary goal in this work is to break this myopic view by (i) proposing a
new benchmark for DNN training, called TBD (TBD is short for Training Benchmark
for DNNs), that uses a representative set of DNN models that cover a wide range
of machine learning applications: image classification, machine translation,
speech recognition, object detection, adversarial networks, reinforcement
learning, and (ii) by performing an extensive performance analysis of training
these different applications on three major deep learning frameworks

multi-GPU, and multi-machine). TBD currently covers six major application
domains and eight different state-of-the-art models.

component is the conditional intensity function of the Hawkes Process, which
captures the fact that interactions may arise as a response to past
interactions (reciprocity), or due to shared interests between individuals

heterogeneity, the base (non time dependent) part of the intensity function
builds on compound random measures following Todeschini et al. (2016). We

consistency of the procedure (i.e., the convergence of the misclassification
rate to zero) under a general bipartite stochastic block model. We show that
the procedure is optimal in the sense that it achieves the optimal convergence
rate that is achievable by a biclustering oracle, adaptively over the whole
class, up to constants. This is further formalized by deriving a minimax lower
bound over a class of biclustering problems. The optimal rate we obtain
sharpens some of the existing results and generalizes others to a wide regime
of average degree growth, from sparse networks with average degrees growing
arbitrarily slowly to fairly dense networks with average degrees of order
$\sqrt{n}$. As a special case, we recover the known exact recovery threshold in

the aforementioned equipment so they are not able to calculate the lactate
threshold without resorting to an expensive and specialized centre. Therefore,
the main objective of this study is to create an intelligent system capable of
estimating the lactate threshold of recreational athletes participating in
endurance running sports. The solution here proposed is based on a machine
learning system which models the lactate evolution using recurrent neural
networks and includes the proposal of standardization of the temporal axis as
well as a modification of the stratified sampling method. The results show that
the proposed system accurately estimates the lactate threshold of 89.52% of the
athletes and its correlation with the experimentally measured lactate threshold
is very high (R=0,89). Moreover, its behaviour with the test dataset is as good
as with the training set, meaning that the generalization power of the model is
high. Therefore, in this study a machine learning based system is proposed as

results.
  We provide provable guarantees for deterministic column sampling using ridge
leverage scores. The matrix sketch returned by our algorithm is a column subset
of the original matrix, yielding additional interpretability. Like the
randomized counterparts, the deterministic algorithm provides (1 + {\epsilon})
error column subset selection, (1 + {\epsilon}) error projection-cost
preservation, and an additive-multiplicative spectral bound. We also show that

deterministic algorithm is provably as accurate as randomized algorithms.
  Lastly, ridge regression is frequently used to regularize ill-posed linear
least-squares problems. While ridge regression provides shrinkage for the
regression coefficients, many of the coefficients remain small but non-zero.

http://arxiv.org/abs/1803.05976v1,Deep Choice Model Using Pointer Networks for Airline Itinerary Prediction,"Travel providers such as airlines and on-line travel agents are becoming more
and more interested in understanding how passengers choose among alternative
itineraries when searching for flights. This knowledge helps them better
display and adapt their offer, taking into account market conditions and
customer needs. Some common applications are not only filtering and sorting
alternatives, but also changing certain attributes in real-time (e.g., changing
the price). In this paper, we concentrate with the problem of modeling air
passenger choices of flight itineraries. This problem has historically been
tackled using classical Discrete Choice Modelling techniques. Traditional
statistical approaches, in particular the Multinomial Logit model (MNL), is
widely used in industrial applications due to its simplicity and general good
performance. However, MNL models present several shortcomings and assumptions
that might not hold in real applications. To overcome these difficulties, we
present a new choice model based on Pointer Networks. Given an input sequence,
this type of deep neural architecture combines Recurrent Neural Networks with
the Attention Mechanism to learn the conditional probability of an output whose
values correspond to positions in an input sequence. Therefore, given a
sequence of different alternatives presented to a customer, the model can learn
to point to the one most likely to be chosen by the customer. The proposed
method was evaluated on a real dataset that combines on-line user search logs
and airline flight bookings. Experimental results show that the proposed model
outperforms the traditional MNL model on several metrics.","['Alejandro Mottini', 'Rodrigo Acuna-Agost']","['stat.ML', 'cs.LG']",2018-03-15 19:55:56+00:00

processors, and their capabilities depend upon the transfer function that
relates each local processor's outputs to its inputs. This paper uses a recent
advance in the foundations of information theory to study the properties of
local processors that use contextual input to amplify or attenuate transmission
of information about their driving inputs. This advance enables the information
transmitted by processors with two distinct inputs to be decomposed into those
components unique to each input, that shared between the two inputs, and that
which depends on both though it is in neither, i.e. synergy. The decompositions
that we report here show that contextual modulation has information processing
properties that contrast with those of all four simple arithmetic operators,
that it can take various forms, and that the form used in our previous studies
of artificial neural nets composed of local processors with both driving and
contextual inputs is particularly well-suited to provide the distinctive
capabilities of contextual modulation under a wide range of conditions. We
argue that the decompositions reported here could be compared with those
obtained from empirical neurobiological and psychophysical data under
conditions thought to reflect contextual modulation. That would then shed new
light on the underlying processes involved. Finally, we suggest that such
decompositions could aid the design of context-sensitive machine learning
algorithms.","['Jim W. Kay', 'William A. Phillips']","['cs.IT', 'math.IT', 'q-bio.NC', 'q-bio.QM', 'stat.ML']",2018-03-15 17:51:21+00:00

planning often lack sufficient amounts of time-series data to estimate
statistical models for the purpose of scientific discovery. Moreover, the
available limited data are quite noisy. This presents a major challenge when
estimating time-series models that are robust to overfitting and have
well-calibrated uncertainty estimates. Most of the current literature in these
fields involve visualizing the time-series for noticeable structure and hard
coding them into pre-specified parametric functions. This approach is
associated with two limitations. First, given that such trends may not be
easily noticeable in small data, it is difficult to explicitly incorporate
expressive structure into the models during formulation. Second, it is
difficult to know $\textit{a priori}$ the most appropriate functional form to
use. To address these limitations, a nonparametric Bayesian approach was
proposed to implicitly capture hidden structure from time series having limited
data. The proposed model, a Gaussian process with a spectral mixture kernel,
precludes the need to pre-specify a functional form and hard code trends, is
robust to overfitting and has well-calibrated uncertainty estimates.","['Daniel Emaasit', 'Matthew Johnson']","['stat.ML', 'cs.LG']",2018-03-15 17:03:04+00:00

Current approaches commonly focus on ranking by scoring, i.e., on learning an

instance of such forests is the \emph{Mondrian Forest}, whose trees are built
using the so-called Mondrian process, therefore allowing to easily update their
construction in a streaming fashion. In this paper, we provide a thorough
theoretical study of Mondrian Forests in a batch learning setting, based on new

convergence rates for Mondrian Trees and Forests, that turn out to be minimax
optimal on the set of $s$-H\""older function with $s \in (0,1]$ (for trees and

combining Mondrian Forests with a standard model aggregation algorithm. These

applications in which the intrinsic dimension of high-dimensional data is often
smaller than the ambient dimension. Spectral clustering, as one of the main
approaches to subspace clustering, often takes on a sparse representation or a
low-rank representation to learn a block diagonal self-representation matrix
for subspace generation. However, existing methods require solving a large
scale convex optimization problem with a large set of data, with computational
complexity reaches O(N^3) for N data points. Therefore, the efficiency and
scalability of traditional spectral clustering methods can not be guaranteed
for large scale datasets. In this paper, we propose a subspace clustering model
based on the Kronecker product. Due to the property that the Kronecker product
of a block diagonal matrix with any other matrix is still a block diagonal
matrix, we can efficiently learn the representation matrix which is formed by
the Kronecker product of k smaller matrices. By doing so, our model
significantly reduces the computational complexity to O(kN^{3/k}). Furthermore,
our model is general in nature, and can be adapted to different regularization
based subspace clustering methods. Experimental results on two public datasets

better data partition implies faster convergence rate. Furthermore, pSCOPE is
also communication efficient. Experimental results on real data sets show that

However, most large margin algorithms are applicable only to shallow models
with a preset feature representation; and conventional margin methods for
neural networks only enforce margin at the output layer. Such methods are
therefore not well suited for deep networks.
  In this work, we propose a novel loss function to impose a margin on any

formulation allows choosing any norm on the metric measuring the margin. We
demonstrate that the decision boundary obtained by our loss has nice properties

improved empirical results on the MNIST, CIFAR-10 and ImageNet datasets on

Nesterov's accelerated gradient descent (NAG) method are widely used in
practice for training deep networks and other supervised learning models, as
they often provide significant improvements over stochastic gradient descent
(SGD). Rigorously speaking, ""fast gradient"" methods have provable improvements
over gradient descent only for the deterministic case, where the gradients are
exact. In the stochastic case, the popular explanations for their wide
applicability is that when these fast gradient methods are applied in the
stochastic case, they partially mimic their exact gradient counterparts,
resulting in some practical gain. This work provides a counterpoint to this
belief by proving that there exist simple problem instances where these methods
cannot outperform SGD despite the best setting of its parameters. These
negative problem instances are, in an informal sense, generic; they do not look
like carefully constructed pathological instances. These results suggest (along
with empirical evidence) that HB or NAG's practical performance gains are a
by-product of mini-batching.
  Furthermore, this work provides a viable (and provable) alternative, which,
on the same set of problem instances, significantly improves over HB, NAG, and
SGD's performance. This algorithm, referred to as Accelerated Stochastic
Gradient Descent (ASGD), is a simple to implement stochastic algorithm, based

class label function varies smoothly on the data graph, resulting in the rather
strict prior that the label function has low-frequency content. Meanwhile, in
many classification problems, the label function may vary abruptly in certain
graph regions, resulting in high-frequency components. Although the
semi-supervised estimation of class labels is an ill-posed problem in general,
in several applications it is possible to find a source graph on which the
label function has similar frequency content to that on the target graph where
the actual classification problem is defined. In this paper, we propose a
method for domain adaptation on graphs motivated by these observations. Our
algorithm is based on learning the spectrum of the label function in a source
graph with many labeled nodes, and transferring the information of the spectrum
to the target graph with fewer labeled nodes. While the frequency content of
the class label function can be identified through the graph Fourier transform,
it is not easy to transfer the Fourier coefficients directly between the two
graphs, since no one-to-one match exists between the Fourier basis vectors of
independently constructed graphs in the domain adaptation setting. We solve
this problem by learning a transformation between the Fourier bases of the two
graphs that flexibly ``aligns'' them. The unknown class label function on the
target graph is then reconstructed such that its spectrum matches that on the
source graph while also ensuring the consistency with the available labels. The
proposed method is tested in the classification of image, online product

progressive disease, such as cancer or Alzheimer's. Progressive diseases often
start with mild symptoms that might precede a diagnosis, and each patient
follows their own trajectory. Patient trajectories exhibit wild variability,
which can be associated with many factors such as genotype, age, or sex. An
additional layer of complexity is that, in real life, the amount and type of
data available for each patient can differ significantly. For example, for one
patient we might have no prior history, whereas for another patient we might
have detailed clinical assessments obtained at multiple prior time-points. This
paper presents a probabilistic model that can handle multiple modalities
(including images and clinical assessments) and variable patient histories with
irregular timings and missing entries, to predict clinical scores at future
time-points. We use a sigmoidal function to model latent disease progression,
which gives rise to clinical observations in our generative model. We
implemented an approximate Bayesian inference strategy on the proposed model to
estimate the parameters on data from a large population of subjects.
Furthermore, the Bayesian framework enables the model to automatically
fine-tune its predictions based on historical observations that might be
available on the test subject. We applied our method to a longitudinal
Alzheimer's disease dataset with more than 3000 subjects [23] and present a

tensor dimensions vary across one of the modes. An example scenario is modeling
treatments across a set of patients with the varying number of medical
encounters over time. Despite recent improvements on unconstrained PARAFAC2,
its model factors are usually dense and sensitive to noise which limits their
interpretability. As a result, the following open challenges remain: a) various
modeling constraints, such as temporal smoothness, sparsity and non-negativity,
are needed to be imposed for interpretable temporal modeling and b) a scalable
approach is required to support those constraints efficiently for large
datasets. To tackle these challenges, we propose a {\it CO}nstrained {\it
PA}RAFAC2 (COPA) method, which carefully incorporates optimization constraints
such as temporal smoothness, sparsity, and non-negativity in the resulting
factors. To efficiently support all those constraints, COPA adopts a hybrid
optimization framework using alternating optimization and alternating direction
method of multiplier (AO-ADMM). As evaluated on large electronic health record
(EHR) datasets with hundreds of thousands of patients, COPA achieves
significant speedups (up to 36 times faster) over prior PARAFAC2 approaches

Overall, our method outperforms all the baselines attempting to handle a subset
of the constraints in terms of speed, while achieving the same level of
accuracy. Through a case study on temporal phenotyping of medically complex

http://arxiv.org/abs/1803.04566v2,Compact Convolutional Neural Networks for Classification of Asynchronous Steady-state Visual Evoked Potentials,"Steady-State Visual Evoked Potentials (SSVEPs) are neural oscillations from
the parietal and occipital regions of the brain that are evoked from flickering
visual stimuli. SSVEPs are robust signals measurable in the
electroencephalogram (EEG) and are commonly used in brain-computer interfaces
(BCIs). However, methods for high-accuracy decoding of SSVEPs usually require
hand-crafted approaches that leverage domain-specific knowledge of the stimulus
signals, such as specific temporal frequencies in the visual stimuli and their
relative spatial arrangement. When this knowledge is unavailable, such as when
SSVEP signals are acquired asynchronously, such approaches tend to fail. In
this paper, we show how a compact convolutional neural network (Compact-CNN),
which only requires raw EEG signals for automatic feature extraction, can be
used to decode signals from a 12-class SSVEP dataset without the need for any
domain-specific knowledge or calibration data. We report across subject mean
accuracy of approximately 80% (chance being 8.3%) and show this is
substantially better than current state-of-the-art hand-crafted approaches
using canonical correlation analysis (CCA) and Combined-CCA. Furthermore, we
analyze our Compact-CNN to examine the underlying feature representation,
discovering that the deep learner extracts additional phase and amplitude
related features associated with the structure of the dataset. We discuss how
our Compact-CNN shows promise for BCI applications that allow users to freely
gaze/attend to any stimulus at any time (e.g., asynchronous BCI) as well as
provides a method for analyzing SSVEP signals in a way that might augment our
understanding about the basic processing in the visual cortex.","['Nicholas R. Waytowich', 'Vernon Lawhern', 'Javier O. Garcia', 'Jennifer Cummings', 'Josef Faller', 'Paul Sajda', 'Jean M. Vettel']","['cs.LG', 'q-bio.NC', 'stat.ML']",2018-03-12 23:03:44+00:00

general bipartite stochastic block model (SBM). A modern spectral clustering
algorithm consists of three steps: (1) regularization of an appropriate
adjacency or Laplacian matrix (2) a form of spectral truncation and (3) a
k-means type algorithm in the reduced spectral domain. We focus on the
adjacency-based spectral clustering and for the first step, propose a new
data-driven regularization that can restore the concentration of the adjacency
matrix even for the sparse networks. This result is based on recent work on
regularization of random binary matrices, but avoids using unknown population
level parameters, and instead estimates the necessary quantities from the data.
We also propose and study a novel variation of the spectral truncation step and
show how this variation changes the nature of the misclassification rate in a
general SBM. We then show how the consistency results can be extended to models
beyond SBMs, such as inhomogeneous random graph models with approximate
clusters, including a graphon clustering problem, as well as general
sub-Gaussian biclustering. A theme of the paper is providing a better
understanding of the analysis of spectral methods for community detection and
establishing consistency results, under fairly general clustering models and
for a wide regime of degree growths, including sparse cases where the average
expected degree grows arbitrarily slowly.","['Zhixin Zhou', 'Arash A. Amini']","['math.ST', 'cs.SI', 'stat.ML', 'stat.TH']",2018-03-12 21:50:58+00:00

primarily theoretical study, we limit ourselves to a single-layer network. The
first problem we study corresponds to dictionary-learning in the presence of
nonlinearity (modeled by the ReLU functions). Given a set of observation
vectors $\mathbf{y}^i \in \mathbb{R}^d, i =1, 2, \dots , n$, we aim to recover
$d\times k$ matrix $A$ and the latent vectors $\{\mathbf{c}^i\} \subset

that it is possible to recover the column space of $A$ within an error of
$O(d)$ (in Frobenius norm) under certain conditions on the probability
distribution of $\mathbf{b}$.
  The second problem we consider is that of robust recovery of the signal in
the presence of outliers, i.e., large but sparse noise. In this setting we are
interested in recovering the latent vector $\mathbf{c}$ from its noisy
nonlinear sketches of the form $\mathbf{v} = \mathrm{ReLU}(A\mathbf{c}) +
