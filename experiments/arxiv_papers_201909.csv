http://arxiv.org/abs/1910.03134v4,Partial Separability and Functional Graphical Models for Multivariate Gaussian Processes,"The covariance structure of multivariate functional data can be highly
complex, especially if the multivariate dimension is large, making extensions
of statistical methods for standard multivariate data to the functional data
setting challenging. For example, Gaussian graphical models have recently been
extended to the setting of multivariate functional data by applying
multivariate methods to the coefficients of truncated basis expansions.
However, a key difficulty compared to multivariate data is that the covariance
operator is compact, and thus not invertible. The methodology in this paper
addresses the general problem of covariance modeling for multivariate
functional data, and functional Gaussian graphical models in particular. As a
first step, a new notion of separability for the covariance operator of
multivariate functional data is proposed, termed partial separability, leading
to a novel Karhunen-Lo\`eve-type expansion for such data. Next, the partial
separability structure is shown to be particularly useful in order to provide a
well-defined functional Gaussian graphical model that can be identified with a
sequence of finite-dimensional graphical models, each of identical fixed
dimension. This motivates a simple and efficient estimation procedure through
application of the joint graphical lasso. Empirical performance of the method
for graphical model estimation is assessed through simulation and analysis of
functional brain connectivity during a motor task. %Empirical performance of

translations, and enumerations remains a challenging task. Meanwhile, neural
networks utilizing symmetry invariant layers have been shown to be able to
optimize their training objective in a data-efficient way. In this spirit, we
present an architecture which allows to produce valid Euclidean distance
matrices, which by construction are already invariant under rotation and
translation of the described object. Motivated by the goal to generate
molecular structures in Cartesian space, we use this architecture to construct
a Wasserstein GAN utilizing a permutation invariant critic network. This makes
it possible to generate molecular structures in a one-shot fashion by producing
Euclidean distance matrices which have a three-dimensional embedding.","['Moritz Hoffmann', 'Frank Noé']","['cs.LG', 'stat.ML']",2019-10-07 23:30:05+00:00
http://arxiv.org/abs/1910.03127v1,Evaluating Scalable Uncertainty Estimation Methods for DNN-Based Molecular Property Prediction,"Advances in deep neural network (DNN) based molecular property prediction
have recently led to the development of models of remarkable accuracy and
generalization ability, with graph convolution neural networks (GCNNs)
reporting state-of-the-art performance for this task. However, some challenges
remain and one of the most important that needs to be fully addressed concerns
uncertainty quantification. DNN performance is affected by the volume and the
quality of the training samples. Therefore, establishing when and to what
extent a prediction can be considered reliable is just as important as
outputting accurate predictions, especially when out-of-domain molecules are
targeted. Recently, several methods to account for uncertainty in DNNs have
been proposed, most of which are based on approximate Bayesian inference. Among
these, only a few scale to the large datasets required in applications.
Evaluating and comparing these methods has recently attracted great interest,
but results are generally fragmented and absent for molecular property
prediction. In this paper, we aim to quantitatively compare scalable techniques
for uncertainty estimation in GCNNs. We introduce a set of quantitative
criteria to capture different uncertainty aspects, and then use these criteria
to compare MC-Dropout, deep ensembles, and bootstrapping, both theoretically in
a unified framework that separates aleatoric/epistemic uncertainty and
experimentally on the QM9 dataset. Our experiments quantify the performance of
the different uncertainty estimation methods and their impact on
uncertainty-related error reduction. Our findings indicate that ensembling and
bootstrapping consistently outperform MC-Dropout, with different
context-specific pros and cons. Our analysis also leads to a better
understanding of the role of aleatoric/epistemic uncertainty and highlights the
challenge posed by out-of-domain uncertainty.","['Gabriele Scalia', 'Colin A. Grambow', 'Barbara Pernici', 'Yi-Pei Li', 'William H. Green']","['cs.LG', 'stat.ML']",2019-10-07 23:04:43+00:00

state-of-the-art deep learning in mobile and edge settings where the
computation and energy budgets are highly limited. Recently, Liu et al. (2019)
framed the search of efficient neural architectures into a continuous splitting
process: it iteratively splits existing neurons into multiple off-springs to
achieve progressive loss minimization, thus finding novel architectures by
gradually growing the neural network. However, this method was not specifically
tailored for designing energy-efficient networks, and is computationally
expensive on large-scale benchmarks. In this work, we substantially improve Liu
et al. (2019) in two significant ways: 1) we incorporate the energy cost of
splitting different neurons to better guide the splitting process, thereby
discovering more energy-efficient network architectures; 2) we substantially
speed up the splitting process of Liu et al. (2019), which requires expensive
eigen-decomposition, by proposing a highly scalable Rayleigh-quotient
stochastic gradient algorithm. Our fast algorithm allows us to reduce the
computational cost of splitting to the same level of typical back-propagation
updates and enables efficient implementation on GPU. Extensive empirical
results show that our method can train highly accurate and energy-efficient

finance and insurance industries. Examples are fraudulent credit card
transactions or fraudulent claims. It has been estimated that roughly $10$
percent of the insurance industry's incurred losses and loss adjustment

digitization in finance and insurance have lead to big data sets, consisting in
particular of text data, which can be used for fraud detection. In this paper,
we propose architectures for text embeddings via deep learning, which help to
improve the detection of fraudulent claims compared to other machine learning
methods. We illustrate our methods using a data set from a large international
health insurance company. The empirical results show that our approach
outperforms other state-of-the-art methods and can help make the claims
management process more efficient. As (unstructured) text data become
increasingly available to economists and econometricians, our proposed methods
will be valuable for many similar applications, particularly when variables

http://arxiv.org/abs/1910.03016v4,Is a Good Representation Sufficient for Sample Efficient Reinforcement Learning?,"Modern deep learning methods provide effective means to learn good
representations. However, is a good representation itself sufficient for sample
efficient reinforcement learning? This question has largely been studied only
with respect to (worst-case) approximation error, in the more classical
approximate dynamic programming literature. With regards to the statistical
viewpoint, this question is largely unexplored, and the extant body of
literature mainly focuses on conditions which permit sample efficient
reinforcement learning with little understanding of what are necessary
conditions for efficient reinforcement learning.
  This work shows that, from the statistical viewpoint, the situation is far
subtler than suggested by the more traditional approximation viewpoint, where
the requirements on the representation that suffice for sample efficient RL are
even more stringent. Our main results provide sharp thresholds for
reinforcement learning methods, showing that there are hard limitations on what
constitutes good function approximation (in terms of the dimensionality of the
representation), where we focus on natural representational conditions relevant
to value-based, model-based, and policy-based learning. These lower bounds
highlight that having a good (value-based, model-based, or policy-based)
representation in and of itself is insufficient for efficient reinforcement
learning, unless the quality of this approximation passes certain hard
thresholds. Furthermore, our lower bounds also imply exponential separations on
the sample complexity between 1) value-based learning with perfect
representation and value-based learning with a good-but-not-perfect
representation, 2) value-based learning and policy-based learning, 3)
policy-based learning and supervised learning and 4) reinforcement learning and
imitation learning.","['Simon S. Du', 'Sham M. Kakade', 'Ruosong Wang', 'Lin F. Yang']","['cs.LG', 'cs.AI', 'math.OC', 'stat.ML']",2019-10-07 19:04:43+00:00

challenge in the domain of robot learning. Given the intractability of the
global control problem, state-of-the-art algorithms focus on approximate
sequential optimization techniques, that heavily rely on heuristics for
regularization in order to achieve stable convergence. By building upon the
duality between inference and control, we develop the view of Optimal Control
as Input Estimation, devising a probabilistic stochastic optimal control
formulation that iteratively infers the optimal input distributions by
minimizing an upper bound of the control cost. Inference is performed through
Expectation Maximization and message passing on a probabilistic graphical model
of the dynamical system, and time-varying linear Gaussian feedback controllers
are extracted from the joint state-action distribution. This perspective
incorporates uncertainty quantification, effective initialization through
priors, and the principled regularization inherent to the Bayesian treatment.
Moreover, it can be shown that for deterministic linearized systems, our
framework derives the maximum entropy linear quadratic optimal control law. We
provide a complete and detailed derivation of our probabilistic approach and

demonstrate that deep residual networks trained with gradient descent have a
small generalization gap between training and test error, and together with
(ii) this guarantees that the test error will be small. Our optimization and
generalization guarantees require overparameterization that is only logarithmic
in the depth of the network, while all known generalization bounds for deep

$\kappa$-Value Iteration ($\kappa$-VI). These methods iteratively compute the
next policy ($\kappa$-PI) and value function ($\kappa$-VI) by solving a
surrogate decision problem with a shaped reward and a smaller discount factor.
We derive model-free RL algorithms based on $\kappa$-PI and $\kappa$-VI in
which the surrogate problem can be solved by any discrete or continuous action
RL method, such as DQN and TRPO. We identify the importance of a
hyper-parameter that controls the extent to which the surrogate problem is
solved and suggest a way to set this parameter. When evaluated on a range of

http://arxiv.org/abs/1910.02806v3,Learning De-biased Representations with Biased Representations,"Many machine learning algorithms are trained and evaluated by splitting data
from a single source into training and test sets. While such focus on
in-distribution learning scenarios has led to interesting advancement, it has
not been able to tell if models are relying on dataset biases as shortcuts for
successful prediction (e.g., using snow cues for recognising snowmobiles),
resulting in biased models that fail to generalise when the bias shifts to a
different class. The cross-bias generalisation problem has been addressed by
de-biasing training data through augmentation or re-sampling, which are often
prohibitive due to the data collection cost (e.g., collecting images of a
snowmobile on a desert) and the difficulty of quantifying or expressing biases
in the first place. In this work, we propose a novel framework to train a
de-biased representation by encouraging it to be different from a set of
representations that are biased by design. This tactic is feasible in many
scenarios where it is much easier to define a set of biased representations
than to define and quantify bias. We demonstrate the efficacy of our method
across a variety of synthetic and real-world biases; our experiments show that
the method discourages models from taking bias shortcuts, resulting in improved
generalisation. Source code is available at https://github.com/clovaai/rebias.","['Hyojin Bahng', 'Sanghyuk Chun', 'Sangdoo Yun', 'Jaegul Choo', 'Seong Joon Oh']","['cs.CV', 'cs.LG', 'stat.ML']",2019-10-07 14:11:13+00:00

Attractor networks provide a sound model of associative memory: patterns are
stored as attractors of the network dynamics and associative retrieval is
performed by running the dynamics starting from a query pattern until it
converges to an attractor. In such models the dynamics are often implemented as
an optimization procedure that minimizes an energy function, such as in the
classical Hopfield network. In general it is difficult to derive a writing rule
for a given dynamics and energy that is both compressive and fast. Thus, most
research in energy-based memory has been limited either to tractable energy
models not expressive enough to handle complex high-dimensional objects such as
natural images, or to models that do not offer fast writing. We present a novel

Humans' ability of learning and accumulating knowledge over their lifetime is

higher level of machine intelligence through providing the artificial agents
with the ability to learn online from a non-stationary and never-ending stream
of data. A key component of such a never-ending learning process is to overcome
the catastrophic forgetting of previously seen data, a problem that neural
networks are well known to suffer from. The work described in this thesis has
been dedicated to the investigation of continual learning and solutions to
mitigate the forgetting phenomena in neural networks. To approach the continual
learning problem, we first assume a task incremental setting where tasks are
received one at a time and data from previous tasks are not stored. Since the
task incremental setting can't be assumed in all continual learning scenarios,
we also study the more general online continual setting. We consider an
infinite stream of data drawn from a non-stationary distribution with a

networks (DNNs) tend to overfit using a few samples only, typical meta-learning

taking their weights as a warm start of meta-training, and (2) freezing their

transfer the weights of a deep NN for few-shot learning tasks. Specifically,
meta refers to training multiple tasks, and transfer is achieved by learning
scaling and shifting functions of DNN weights for each task. In addition, we

recursively, this test yields a method for hierarchical clustering that is
equipped with a significance guarantee. We study the limiting distribution and
power of this approach in some examples and show that there are large regions

mixture of Gaussians provides a better fit relative to a single Gaussian,
without assuming that either model is correct. The proposed test has a simple
critical value and provides provable error control. One version of our test

small number of synthetic samples containing all the information of a large
dataset. This has several benefits like speeding up model training, reducing
energy consumption, and reducing required storage space. Currently, each
synthetic sample is assigned a single `hard' label, and also, dataset
distillation can currently only be used with image data.
  We propose to simultaneously distill both images and their labels, thus
assigning each synthetic sample a `soft' label (a distribution of labels). Our
algorithm increases accuracy by 2-4% over the original algorithm for several
image classification tasks. Using `soft' labels also enables distilled datasets
to consist of fewer samples than there are classes as each sample can encode
information for multiple classes. For example, training a LeNet model with 10
distilled images (one per class) results in over 96% accuracy on MNIST, and
almost 92% accuracy when trained on just 5 distilled images.
  We also extend the dataset distillation algorithm to distill sequential
datasets including texts. We demonstrate that text distillation outperforms
other methods across multiple datasets. For example, models attain almost their
original accuracy on the IMDB sentiment analysis task using just 20 distilled
sentences.

reliability analysis using Monte Carlo sampling for expensive-to-evaluate

high-fidelity model. The method builds on the Efficient Global Reliability
Analysis (EGRA) method, which is a surrogate-based method that uses adaptive
sampling for refining Gaussian process surrogates for failure boundary location
using a single-fidelity model. Our method introduces a two-stage adaptive
sampling criterion that uses a multifidelity Gaussian process surrogate to
leverage multiple information sources with different fidelities. The method
combines expected feasibility criterion from EGRA with one-step lookahead
information gain to refine the surrogate around the failure boundary. The
computational savings from mfEGRA depends on the discrepancy between the
different models, and the relative cost of evaluating the different models as
compared to the high-fidelity model. We show that accurate estimation of
reliability using mfEGRA leads to computational savings of $\sim$46% for an
analytic multimodal test problem and 24% for a three-dimensional acoustic horn
problem, when compared to single-fidelity EGRA. We also show the effect of
using a priori drawn Monte Carlo samples in the implementation for the acoustic

invariant functions, DeepSets and PointNet are not known to be universal when
approximating \emph{equivariant} set functions. On the other hand, several
recent equivariant set architectures have been proven equivariant universal
[Sannai et al. 2019], [Keriven et al. 2019], however these models either use
layers that are not permutation equivariant (in the standard sense) and/or use
higher order tensor variables which are less practical.
  There is, therefore, a gap in understanding the universality of popular
equivariant set models versus theoretical ones.
  In this paper we close this gap by proving that: (i) PointNet is not
equivariant universal; and (ii) adding a single linear transmission layer makes
PointNet universal. We call this architecture PointNetST and argue it is the
simplest permutation equivariant universal model known to date. Another
consequence is that DeepSets is universal, and also PointNetSeg, a popular
point cloud segmentation network (used eg, in [Qi et al. 2017]) is universal.

http://arxiv.org/abs/1910.02352v2,Operational Calibration: Debugging Confidence Errors for DNNs in the Field,"Trained DNN models are increasingly adopted as integral parts of software
systems, but they often perform deficiently in the field. A particularly
damaging problem is that DNN models often give false predictions with high
confidence, due to the unavoidable slight divergences between operation data
and training data. To minimize the loss caused by inaccurate confidence,
operational calibration, i.e., calibrating the confidence function of a DNN
classifier against its operation domain, becomes a necessary debugging step in
the engineering of the whole system.
  Operational calibration is difficult considering the limited budget of
labeling operation data and the weak interpretability of DNN models. We propose
a Bayesian approach to operational calibration that gradually corrects the
confidence given by the model under calibration with a small number of labeled
operation data deliberately selected from a larger set of unlabeled operation
data. The approach is made effective and efficient by leveraging the locality
of the learned representation of the DNN model and modeling the calibration as
Gaussian Process Regression. Comprehensive experiments with various practical
datasets and DNN models show that it significantly outperformed alternative
methods, and in some difficult tasks it eliminated about 71% to 97%
high-confidence (>0.9) errors with only about 10\% of the minimal amount of
labeled operation data needed for practical learning techniques to barely work.","['Zenan Li', 'Xiaoxing Ma', 'Chang Xu', 'Jingwei Xu', 'Chun Cao', 'Jian Lü']","['cs.LG', 'cs.SE', 'stat.ML']",2019-10-06 01:21:14+00:00

(EnKF) and the feedback particle filter (FPF) are numerical algorithms to
approximate the solution of the nonlinear filtering problem in continuous time.
The distinguishing feature of these algorithms is that the Bayesian update step
is implemented using a feedback control law. It has been noted in the
literature that the control law is not unique. This is the main problem
addressed in this paper. To obtain a unique control law, the filtering problem
is formulated here as an optimal transportation problem. An explicit formula
for the (mean-field type) optimal control law is derived in the linear Gaussian
setting. Comparisons are made with the control laws for different types of EnKF
algorithms described in the literature. Via empirical approximation of the
mean-field control law, a finite-$N$ controlled interacting particle algorithm
is obtained. For this algorithm, the equations for empirical mean and
covariance are derived and shown to be identical to the Kalman filter. This
allows strong conclusions on convergence and error properties based on the
classical filter stability theory for the Kalman filter. It is shown that,
under certain technical conditions, the mean squared error (m.s.e.) converges
to zero even with a finite number of particles. A detailed propagation of chaos
analysis is carried out for the finite-$N$ algorithm. The analysis is used to
prove weak convergence of the empirical distribution as $N\rightarrow\infty$.
For a certain simplified filtering problem, analytical comparison of the m.s.e.
with the importance sampling-based algorithms is described. The analysis helps
explain the favorable scaling properties of the control-based algorithms

people. The development of software systems based on these models raises
societal and legal concerns, as their decisions may lead to the unfair
treatment of individuals based on attributes like race or gender. Data
preparation is key in any machine learning pipeline, but its effect on fairness
is yet to be studied in detail. In this paper, we evaluate how the fairness and
effectiveness of the learned models are affected by the removal of the
sensitive attribute, the encoding of the categorical attributes, and instance
selection methods (including cross-validators and random undersampling). We
used the Adult Income and the German Credit Data datasets, which are widely
studied and known to have fairness concerns. We applied each data preparation
technique individually to analyse the difference in predictive performance and
fairness, using statistical parity difference, disparate impact, and the
normalised prejudice index. The results show that fairness is affected by
transformations made to the training data, particularly in imbalanced datasets.
Removing the sensitive attribute is insufficient to eliminate all the
unfairness in the predictions, as expected, but it is key to achieve fairer
models. Additionally, the standard random undersampling with respect to the

multi-core and parallel architectures that were designed to efficiently
implement matrix-vector-multiplications (MVMs). This is because at the
fundamental level, neural network and machine learning operations extensively
use MVM operations and hardware compilers exploit the inherent parallelism in
MVM operations to achieve hardware acceleration on GPUs and FPGAs. However,
many IoT and edge computing platforms require embedded ML devices close to the
network in order to compensate for communication cost and latency. Hence a
natural question to ask is whether MVM operations are even necessary to
implement ML algorithms and whether simpler hardware primitives can be used to
implement an ultra-energy-efficient ML processor/architecture. In this paper we
propose an alternate hardware-software codesign of ML and neural network
architectures where instead of using MVM operations and non-linear activation
functions, the architecture only uses simple addition and thresholding
operations to implement inference and learning. At the core of the proposed
approach is margin-propagation (MP) based computation that maps multiplications
into additions and additions into a dynamic rectifying-linear-unit (ReLU)
operations. This mapping results in significant improvement in computational
and hence energy cost. In this paper, we show how the MP network formulation
can be applied for designing linear classifiers, shallow multi-layer

such as fraud detection, cyber intrusion detection and health care monitoring.
It is a challenging problem because it involves a time sequence of graphs, each
of which is usually very large and sparse with heterogeneous vertex degrees,
resulting in a complex, high dimensional mathematical object. Spectral
embedding methods provide an effective way to transform a graph to a lower
dimensional latent Euclidean space that preserves the underlying structure of
the network. Although change detection methods that use spectral embedding are
available, they do not address sparsity and degree heterogeneity that usually
occur in noisy real-world graphs and a majority of these methods focus on
changes in the behaviour of the overall network.
  In this paper, we adapt previously developed techniques in spectral graph
theory and propose a novel concept of applying Procrustes techniques to
embedded points for vertices in a graph to detect changes in entity behaviour.
Our spectral embedding approach not only addresses sparsity and degree
heterogeneity issues, but also obtains an estimate of the appropriate embedding
dimension. We call this method CDP (change detection using Procrustes
analysis). We demonstrate the performance of CDP through extensive simulation
experiments and a real-world application. CDP successfully detects various
types of vertex-based changes including (i) changes in vertex degree, (ii)
changes in community membership of vertices, and (iii) unusual increase or
decrease in edge weight between vertices. The change detection performance of
CDP is compared with two other baseline methods that employ alternative
spectral embedding approaches. In both cases, CDP generally shows superior
performance.","['Isuru Udayangani Hewapathirana', 'Dominic Lee', 'Elena Moltchanova', 'Jeanette McLeod']","['cs.LG', 'stat.CO', 'stat.ML', 'G.3; I.5.3; I.6.5']",2019-10-05 18:02:18+00:00

deep learning on large-scale datasets. Previous theoretical studies have shown
various appealing properties of SGLD, ranging from the convergence properties
to the generalization bounds. In this paper, we study the properties of SGLD
from a novel perspective of membership privacy protection (i.e., preventing the

specific sample is used for training a given DNN model, has emerged as a common
threat against deep learning algorithms. To this end, we build a theoretical
framework to analyze the information leakage (w.r.t. the training dataset) of a

prevent the information leakage of the training dataset to a certain extent.
Moreover, our theoretical analysis can be naturally extended to other types of
Stochastic Gradient Markov Chain Monte Carlo (SG-MCMC) methods. Empirical
results on different datasets and models verify our theoretical findings and
suggest that the SGLD algorithm can not only reduce the information leakage but

correlations in a real-world energy social game dataset. To further improve the

generation techniques to augment the training data of a popular commercial
artificial agent across categories of functionality, with the goal of faster
development of new functionality. We explore a variety of encoder-decoder
generative models for synthetic training data generation and propose using
conditional variational auto-encoders. Our approach requires only direct
optimization, works well with limited data and significantly outperforms the
previous controlled text generation techniques. Further, the generated data are
used as additional training samples in an extrinsic intent classification task,
leading to improved performance by up to 5\% absolute f-score in low-resource
cases, validating the usefulness of our approach.","['Nikolaos Malandrakis', 'Minmin Shen', 'Anuj Goyal', 'Shuyang Gao', 'Abhishek Sethi', 'Angeliki Metallinou']","['cs.CL', 'cs.LG', 'stat.ML']",2019-10-04 20:44:21+00:00
http://arxiv.org/abs/1910.02136v2,Risks of Using Non-verified Open Data: A case study on using Machine Learning techniques for predicting Pregnancy Outcomes in India,"Artificial intelligence (AI) has evolved considerably in the last few years.
While applications of AI is now becoming more common in fields like retail and
marketing, application of AI in solving problems related to developing
countries is still an emerging topic. Specially, AI applications in
resource-poor settings remains relatively nascent. There is a huge scope of AI
being used in such settings. For example, researchers have started exploring AI
applications to reduce poverty and deliver a broad range of critical public
services. However, despite many promising use cases, there are many dataset
related challenges that one has to overcome in such projects. These challenges
often take the form of missing data, incorrectly collected data and improperly
labeled variables, among other factors. As a result, we can often end up using
data that is not representative of the problem we are trying to solve. In this
case study, we explore the challenges of using such an open dataset from India,
to predict an important health outcome. We highlight how the use of AI without
proper understanding of reporting metrics can lead to erroneous conclusions.","['Anusua Trivedi', 'Sumit Mukherjee', 'Edmund Tse', 'Anne Ewing', 'Juan Lavista Ferres']","['cs.LG', 'cs.AI', 'stat.ML']",2019-10-04 20:27:20+00:00
http://arxiv.org/abs/1910.02133v1,A Conditional Generative Model for Predicting Material Microstructures from Processing Methods,"Microstructures of a material form the bridge linking processing conditions -
which can be controlled, to the material property - which is the primary
interest in engineering applications. Thus a critical task in material design
is establishing the processing-structure relationship, which requires domain
expertise and techniques that can model the high-dimensional material
microstructure. This work proposes a deep learning based approach that models
the processing-structure relationship as a conditional image synthesis problem.
In particular, we develop an auxiliary classifier Wasserstein GAN with gradient
penalty (ACWGAN-GP) to synthesize microstructures under a given processing
condition. This approach is free of feature engineering, requires modest domain
knowledge and is applicable to a wide range of material systems. We demonstrate
this approach using the ultra high carbon steel (UHCS) database, where each
microstructure is annotated with a label describing the cooling method it was
subjected to. Our results show that ACWGAN-GP can synthesize high-quality
multiphase microstructures for a given cooling method.","['Akshay Iyer', 'Biswadip Dey', 'Arindam Dasgupta', 'Wei Chen', 'Amit Chakraborty']","['eess.IV', 'cond-mat.mtrl-sci', 'cs.LG', 'stat.ML']",2019-10-04 20:13:11+00:00
http://arxiv.org/abs/1910.02120v7,Distributed Learning of Deep Neural Networks using Independent Subnet Training,"Distributed machine learning (ML) can bring more computational resources to
bear than single-machine learning, thus enabling reductions in training time.
Distributed learning partitions models and data over many machines, allowing
model and dataset sizes beyond the available compute power and memory of a
single machine. In practice though, distributed ML is challenging when
distribution is mandatory, rather than chosen by the practitioner. In such
scenarios, data could unavoidably be separated among workers due to limited
memory capacity per worker or even because of data privacy issues. There,
existing distributed methods will utterly fail due to dominant transfer costs
across workers, or do not even apply.
  We propose a new approach to distributed fully connected neural network
learning, called independent subnet training (IST), to handle these cases. In
IST, the original network is decomposed into a set of narrow subnetworks with
the same depth. These subnetworks are then trained locally before parameters
are exchanged to produce new subnets and the training cycle repeats. Such a
naturally ""model parallel"" approach limits memory usage by storing only a
portion of network parameters on each device. Additionally, no requirements
exist for sharing data between workers (i.e., subnet training is local and
independent) and communication volume and frequency are reduced by decomposing
the original network into independent subnets. These properties of IST can cope
with issues due to distributed data, slow interconnects, or limited device
memory, making IST a suitable approach for cases of mandatory distribution. We
show experimentally that IST results in training times that are much lower than
common distributed learning approaches.","['Binhang Yuan', 'Cameron R. Wolfe', 'Chen Dun', 'Yuxin Tang', 'Anastasios Kyrillidis', 'Christopher M. Jermaine']","['cs.LG', 'stat.ML']",2019-10-04 19:46:16+00:00
