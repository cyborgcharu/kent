http://arxiv.org/abs/1804.05436v1,Hidden Hamiltonian Cycle Recovery via Linear Programming,"We introduce the problem of hidden Hamiltonian cycle recovery, where there is
an unknown Hamiltonian cycle in an $n$-vertex complete graph that needs to be
inferred from noisy edge measurements. The measurements are independent and
distributed according to $\calP_n$ for edges in the cycle and $\calQ_n$
otherwise. This formulation is motivated by a problem in genome assembly, where
the goal is to order a set of contigs (genome subsequences) according to their
positions on the genome using long-range linking measurements between the
contigs. Computing the maximum likelihood estimate in this model reduces to a
Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP). Despite the NP-hardness of TSP, we show that
a simple linear programming (LP) relaxation, namely the fractional $2$-factor
(F2F) LP, recovers the hidden Hamiltonian cycle with high probability as $n \to
\infty$ provided that $\alpha_n - \log n \to \infty$, where $\alpha_n
\triangleq -2 \log \int \sqrt{d P_n d Q_n}$ is the R\'enyi divergence of order
$\frac{1}{2}$. This condition is information-theoretically optimal in the sense
that, under mild distributional assumptions, $\alpha_n \geq (1+o(1)) \log n$ is
necessary for any algorithm to succeed regardless of the computational cost.
  Departing from the usual proof techniques based on dual witness construction,
the analysis relies on the combinatorial characterization (in particular, the
half-integrality) of the extreme points of the F2F polytope. Represented as
bicolored multi-graphs, these extreme points are further decomposed into
simpler ""blossom-type"" structures for the large deviation analysis and counting
arguments. Evaluation of the algorithm on real data shows improvements over
existing approaches.","['Vivek Bagaria', 'Jian Ding', 'David Tse', 'Yihong Wu', 'Jiaming Xu']","['cs.DM', 'cs.DS', 'math.PR', 'stat.ML']",2018-04-15 21:58:02+00:00
http://arxiv.org/abs/1804.05433v1,Adaptivity for Regularized Kernel Methods by Lepskii's Principle,"We address the problem of {\it adaptivity} in the framework of reproducing
kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) regression. More precisely, we analyze estimators
arising from a linear regularization scheme $g_\lam$. In practical
applications, an important task is to choose the regularization parameter
$\lam$ appropriately, i.e. based only on the given data and independently on
unknown structural assumptions on the regression function. An attractive
approach avoiding data-splitting is the {\it Lepskii Principle} (LP), also
known as the {\it Balancing Principle} is this setting. We show that a modified
parameter choice based on (LP) is minimax optimal adaptive, up to
$\log\log(n)$. A convenient result is the fact that balancing in $L^2(\nu)-$
norm, which is easiest, automatically gives optimal balancing in all stronger
norms, interpolating between $L^2(\nu)$ and the RKHS. An analogous result is
open for other classical approaches to data dependent choices of the
regularization parameter, e.g. for Hold-Out.",['Nicole Mücke'],"['stat.ML', 'cs.LG']",2018-04-15 21:27:04+00:00
http://arxiv.org/abs/1804.05402v1,Approximating the covariance ellipsoid,"We explore ways in which the covariance ellipsoid ${\cal B}=\{v \in
\mathbb{R}^d : \mathbb{E} <X,v>^2 \leq 1\}$ of a centred random vector $X$ in
$\mathbb{R}^d$ can be approximated by a simple set. The data one is given for
constructing the approximating set consists of $X_1,...,X_N$ that are
independent and distributed as $X$.
  We present a general method that can be used to construct such approximations
and implement it for two types of approximating sets. We first construct a
(random) set ${\cal K}$ defined by a union of intersections of slabs
$H_{z,\alpha}=\{v \in \mathbb{R}^d : |<z,v>| \leq \alpha\}$ (and therefore
${\cal K}$ is actually the output of a neural network with two hidden layers).
The slabs are generated using $X_1,...,X_N$, and under minimal assumptions on
$X$ (e.g., $X$ can be heavy-tailed) it suffices that $N = c_1d
\eta^{-4}\log(2/\eta)$ to ensure that $(1-\eta) {\cal K} \subset {\cal B}
\subset (1+\eta){\cal K}$. In some cases (e.g., if $X$ is rotation invariant
and has marginals that are well behaved in some weak sense), a smaller sample
size suffices: $N = c_1d\eta^{-2}\log(2/\eta)$.
  We then show that if the slabs are replaced by randomly generated ellipsoids
defined using $X_1,...,X_N$, the same degree of approximation is true when $N
\geq c_2d\eta^{-2}\log(2/\eta)$.
  The construction we use is based on the small-ball method.",['Shahar Mendelson'],"['stat.ML', 'cs.LG']",2018-04-15 18:07:44+00:00

adversarial attacks, both in terms of monetary incentives and technical
vulnerability. To this end, we outline the healthcare economy and the
incentives it creates for fraud and provide concrete examples of how and why
such attacks could be realistically carried out. We urge practitioners to be

of learning model parameters from data distributed across multiple edge nodes,
without sending raw data to a centralized place. Our focus is on a generic
class of machine learning models that are trained using gradient-descent based
approaches. We analyze the convergence bound of distributed gradient descent
from a theoretical point of view, based on which we propose a control algorithm

aggregation to minimize the loss function under a given resource budget. The

http://arxiv.org/abs/1804.05267v1,Low-Precision Floating-Point Schemes for Neural Network Training,"The use of low-precision fixed-point arithmetic along with stochastic
rounding has been proposed as a promising alternative to the commonly used
32-bit floating point arithmetic to enhance training neural networks training
in terms of performance and energy efficiency. In the first part of this paper,
the behaviour of the 12-bit fixed-point arithmetic when training a
convolutional neural network with the CIFAR-10 dataset is analysed, showing
that such arithmetic is not the most appropriate for the training phase. After
that, the paper presents and evaluates, under the same conditions, alternative
low-precision arithmetics, starting with the 12-bit floating-point arithmetic.
These two representations are then leveraged using local scaling in order to
increase accuracy and get closer to the baseline 32-bit floating-point
arithmetic. Finally, the paper introduces a simplified model in which both the
outputs and the gradients of the neural networks are constrained to
power-of-two values, just using 7 bits for their representation. The evaluation
demonstrates a minimal loss in accuracy for the proposed Power-of-Two neural
network, avoiding the use of multiplications and divisions and thereby,
significantly reducing the training time as well as the energy consumption and
memory requirements during the training and inference phases.","['Marc Ortiz', 'Adrián Cristal', 'Eduard Ayguadé', 'Marc Casas']","['cs.LG', 'cs.NE', 'stat.ML', 'I.2.6; I.5']",2018-04-14 19:10:07+00:00

http://arxiv.org/abs/1804.05170v2,Model-Free Information Extraction in Enriched Nonlinear Phase-Space,"Detecting anomalies and discovering driving signals is an essential component
of scientific research and industrial practice. Often the underlying mechanism
is highly complex, involving hidden evolving nonlinear dynamics and noise
contamination. When representative physical models and large labeled data sets
are unavailable, as is the case with most real-world applications,
model-dependent Bayesian approaches would yield misleading results, and most
supervised learning machines would also fail to reliably resolve the
intricately evolving systems. Here, we propose an unsupervised machine-learning
approach that operates in a well-constructed function space, whereby the
evolving nonlinear dynamics are captured through a linear functional
representation determined by the Koopman operator. This breakthrough leverages
on the time-feature embedding and the ensuing reconstruction of a phase-space
representation of the dynamics, thereby permitting the reliable identification
of critical global signatures from the whole trajectory. This dramatically
improves over commonly used static local features, which are vulnerable to
unknown transitions or noise. Thanks to its data-driven nature, our method
excludes any prior models and training corpus. We benchmark the astonishing
accuracy of our method on three diverse and challenging problems in: biology,
medicine, and engineering. In all cases, it outperforms existing
state-of-the-art methods. As a new unsupervised information processing

http://arxiv.org/abs/1805.00310v2,On the Limitation of MagNet Defense against $L_1$-based Adversarial Examples,"In recent years, defending adversarial perturbations to natural examples in
order to build robust machine learning models trained by deep neural networks
(DNNs) has become an emerging research field in the conjunction of deep
learning and security. In particular, MagNet consisting of an adversary
detector and a data reformer is by far one of the strongest defenses in the
black-box oblivious attack setting, where the attacker aims to craft
transferable adversarial examples from an undefended DNN model to bypass an
unknown defense module deployed on the same DNN model. Under this setting,
MagNet can successfully defend a variety of attacks in DNNs, including the
high-confidence adversarial examples generated by the Carlini and Wagner's
attack based on the $L_2$ distortion metric. However, in this paper, under the
same attack setting we show that adversarial examples crafted based on the
$L_1$ distortion metric can easily bypass MagNet and mislead the target DNN
image classifiers on MNIST and CIFAR-10. We also provide explanations on why
the considered approach can yield adversarial examples with superior attack
performance and conduct extensive experiments on variants of MagNet to verify
its lack of robustness to $L_1$ distortion based attacks. Notably, our results
substantially weaken the assumption of effective threat models on MagNet that

increasingly aware that decisions should be personalized to each patient,
customer, or voter. A given treatment (e.g. a drug or advertisement) should be
administered only to those who will respond most positively, and certainly not
to those who will be harmed by it. Individual-level treatment effects can be
estimated with tools adapted from machine learning, but different models can
yield contradictory estimates. Unlike risk prediction models, however,
treatment effect models cannot be easily evaluated against each other using a
held-out test set because the true treatment effect itself is never directly
observed. Besides outcome prediction accuracy, several metrics that can
leverage held-out data to evaluate treatment effects models have been proposed,
but they are not widely used. We provide a didactic framework that elucidates
the relationships between the different approaches and compare them all using a
variety of simulations of both randomized and observational data. Our results
show that researchers estimating heterogenous treatment effects need not limit
themselves to a single model-fitting algorithm. Instead of relying on a single
method, multiple models fit by a diverse set of algorithms should be evaluated
against each other using an objective function learned from the validation set.

Lipschitz, and the Lipschitz constant decreases inversely with the number $m$
of functions composed. This implies that $h$ can be represented to any accuracy

small Lipschitz constant. Next, we consider nonlinear regression with a
composition of near-identity nonlinear maps. We show that, regarding Fr\'echet

quadratic criterion in this near-identity region must be a global minimizer. In
contrast, if we consider derivatives with respect to parameters of a fixed-size

near-identity critical points that are suboptimal, even in the realizable case.
Informally, this means that functional gradient methods for residual networks

item latent factors from user-item historic behaviors. To apply it into real
big data scenarios, efficiency becomes the first concern, including offline
model training efficiency and online recommendation efficiency. In this paper,
we propose a Distributed Collaborative Hashing (DCH) model which can
significantly improve both efficiencies. Specifically, we first propose a
distributed learning framework, following the state-of-the-art parameter server
paradigm, to learn the offline collaborative model. Our model can be learnt
efficiently by distributedly computing subgradients in minibatches on workers
and updating model parameters on servers asynchronously. We then adopt hashing
technique to speedup the online recommendation procedure. Recommendation can be
quickly made through exploiting lookup hash tables. We conduct thorough
experiments on two real large-scale datasets. The experimental results
demonstrate that, comparing with the classic and state-of-the-art (distributed)
latent factor models, DCH has comparable performance in terms of recommendation
accuracy but has both fast convergence speed in offline model training
procedure and realtime efficiency in online recommendation procedure.
Furthermore, the encouraging performance of DCH is also shown for several
real-world applications in Ant Financial.","['Chaochao Chen', 'Ziqi Liu', 'Peilin Zhao', 'Longfei Li', 'Jun Zhou', 'Xiaolong Li']","['cs.LG', 'cs.IR', 'stat.ML']",2018-04-13 12:37:51+00:00

most effective anomaly detection methods and extensively adopted in both
research as well as industrial applications. The biggest issue for OC-SVM is
yet the capability to operate with large and high-dimensional datasets due to
optimization complexity. Those problems might be mitigated via dimensionality
reduction techniques such as manifold learning or autoencoder. However,
previous work often treats representation learning and anomaly prediction
separately. In this paper, we propose autoencoder based one-class support
vector machine (AE-1SVM) that brings OC-SVM, with the aid of random Fourier
features to approximate the radial basis kernel, into deep learning context by
combining it with a representation learning architecture and jointly exploit
stochastic gradient descent to obtain end-to-end training. Interestingly, this
also opens up the possible use of gradient-based attribution methods to explain
the decision making for anomaly detection, which has ever been challenging as a
result of the implicit mappings between the input space and the kernel space.
To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to study the
interpretability of deep learning in anomaly detection. We evaluate our method
on a wide range of unsupervised anomaly detection tasks in which our end-to-end

prediction of high-dimensional practical data sets, where the relationship
between input and output data is complex and cannot be represented well by
simple conventional models. Its effectiveness is shown in various tasks,
however, the lack of interpretability of the trained result by a layered neural
network has limited its application area.
  In our previous studies, we proposed methods for extracting a simplified
global structure of a trained layered neural network by classifying the units
into communities according to their connection patterns with adjacent layers.
These methods provided us with knowledge about the strength of the relationship
between communities from the existence of bundled connections, which are
determined by threshold processing of the connection ratio between pairs of
communities.
  However, it has been difficult to understand the role of each community
quantitatively by observing the modular structure. We could only know to which
sets of the input and output dimensions each community was mainly connected, by
tracing the bundled connections from the community to the input and output
layers. Another problem is that the finally obtained modular structure is
changed greatly depending on the setting of the threshold hyperparameter used
for determining bundled connections.
  In this paper, we propose a new method for interpreting quantitatively the
role of each community in inference, by defining the effect of each input
dimension on a community, and the effect of a community on each output
dimension. We show experimentally that our proposed method can reveal the role
of each part of a layered neural network by applying the neural networks to
three types of data sets, extracting communities from the trained network, and

can reduce passengers' waiting times by proactively dispatching vehicles to
locations where pickup requests are anticipated in the future. Yet it is
unclear how to best do this: optimal dispatching requires optimizing over
several sources of uncertainty, including vehicles' travel times to their
dispatched locations, as well as coordinating between vehicles so that they do
not attempt to pick up the same passenger. While prior works have developed
models for this uncertainty and used them to optimize dispatch policies, in
this work we introduce a model-free approach. Specifically, we propose MOVI, a
Deep Q-network (DQN)-based framework that directly learns the optimal vehicle
dispatch policy. Since DQNs scale poorly with a large number of possible
dispatches, we streamline our DQN training and suppose that each individual
vehicle independently learns its own optimal policy, ensuring scalability at
the cost of less coordination between vehicles. We then formulate a centralized
receding-horizon control (RHC) policy to compare with our DQN policies. To
compare these policies, we design and build MOVI as a large-scale realistic
simulator based on 15 million taxi trip records that simulates policy-agnostic
responses to dispatch decisions. We show that the DQN dispatch policy reduces
the number of unserviced requests by 76% compared to without dispatch and 20%
compared to the RHC approach, emphasizing the benefits of a model-free approach
and suggesting that there is limited value to coordinating vehicle actions.

overly simplified assumption, modeling it as a deterministic one-to-one

domain adaptation reduces to aligning source and target domain at class
prediction uncertainty level. We tackle this problem by introducing a method
based on adversarial learning which forces the label uncertainty predictions on
the target domain to be indistinguishable from those on the source domain.
Pre-trained deep neural networks are used to generate deep features having high
transferability across related domains. We perform an extensive experimental
analysis of the proposed method over a wide set of publicly available
pre-trained deep neural networks. Results of our experiments on domain
adaptation tasks for image classification show that class prediction
uncertainty alignment with features extracted from pre-trained deep neural
networks provides an efficient, robust and effective method for domain
adaptation.","['Jeroen Manders', 'Twan van Laarhoven', 'Elena Marchiori']","['stat.ML', 'cs.LG']",2018-04-12 11:56:42+00:00

contrast 4D MR imaging during free breathing and provides in-vivo observations
for treatment planning and guidance. Navigator slices are vital for
retrospective stacking of 2D data slices in this method. However, they also
prolong the acquisition sessions. Temporal interpolation of navigator slices an
be used to reduce the number of navigator acquisitions without degrading
specificity in stacking. In this work, we propose a convolutional neural
network (CNN) based method for temporal interpolation via motion field
prediction. The proposed formulation incorporates the prior knowledge that a
motion field underlies changes in the image intensities over time. Previous
approaches that interpolate directly in the intensity space are prone to
produce blurry images or even remove structures in the images. Our method
avoids such problems and faithfully preserves the information in the image.
Further, an important advantage of our formulation is that it provides an
unsupervised estimation of bi-directional motion fields. We show that these
motion fields can be used to halve the number of registrations required during
4D reconstruction, thus substantially reducing the reconstruction time.","['Lin Zhang', 'Neerav Karani', 'Christine Tanner', 'Ender Konukoglu']","['stat.ML', 'cs.LG']",2018-04-12 11:44:55+00:00
http://arxiv.org/abs/1804.04438v2,Pooling is neither necessary nor sufficient for appropriate deformation stability in CNNs,"Many of our core assumptions about how neural networks operate remain
empirically untested. One common assumption is that convolutional neural
networks need to be stable to small translations and deformations to solve
image recognition tasks. For many years, this stability was baked into CNN
architectures by incorporating interleaved pooling layers. Recently, however,
interleaved pooling has largely been abandoned. This raises a number of
questions: Are our intuitions about deformation stability right at all? Is it
important? Is pooling necessary for deformation invariance? If not, how is
deformation invariance achieved in its absence? In this work, we rigorously
test these questions, and find that deformation stability in convolutional
networks is more nuanced than it first appears: (1) Deformation invariance is
not a binary property, but rather that different tasks require different
degrees of deformation stability at different layers. (2) Deformation stability
is not a fixed property of a network and is heavily adjusted over the course of
training, largely through the smoothness of the convolutional filters. (3)
Interleaved pooling layers are neither necessary nor sufficient for achieving
the optimal form of deformation stability for natural image classification. (4)
Pooling confers too much deformation stability for image classification at
initialization, and during training, networks have to learn to counteract this
inductive bias. Together, these findings provide new insights into the role of
interleaved pooling and deformation invariance in CNNs, and demonstrate the
importance of rigorous empirical testing of even our most basic assumptions
about the working of neural networks.","['Avraham Ruderman', 'Neil C. Rabinowitz', 'Ari S. Morcos', 'Daniel Zoran']","['cs.CV', 'cs.LG', 'stat.ML']",2018-04-12 11:44:05+00:00

involve high-dimensional latent variables, requiring dealing with distributions
in high dimensions and making it difficult to learn domain changes from few

representation of joint distributions, we then decompose the joint distribution
into separate modules, each of which involves different low-dimensional latent
variables and can be learned separately, leading to a Causal G-DAN (CG-DAN).
This improves both statistical and computational efficiency of the learning
procedure. Finally, by matching the feature distribution in the target domain,
we can recover the target-domain joint distribution and derive the learning

has been extensively studied in brain science, psychology, and other
disciplines. Decision-making mechanisms have also been experimentally
implemented in physical processes, such as single photons and chaotic lasers.
The findings of these experiments suggest that there is a certain common basis
in describing decision making, regardless of its physical realizations. In this
study, we propose a local reservoir model to account for choice-based learning
(CBL). CBL describes decision consistency as a phenomenon where making a
certain decision increases the possibility of making that same decision again
later, which has been intensively investigated in neuroscience, psychology,
etc. Our proposed model is inspired by the viewpoint that a decision is
affected by its local environment, which is referred to as a local reservoir.
If the size of the local reservoir is large enough, consecutive decision making
will not be affected by previous decisions, thus showing lower degrees of
decision consistency in CBL. In contrast, if the size of the local reservoir
decreases, a biased distribution occurs within it, which leads to higher
degrees of decision consistency in CBL. In this study, an analytical approach
on local reservoirs is presented, as well as several numerical demonstrations.
Furthermore, a physical architecture for CBL based on single photons is
discussed, and the effects of local reservoirs is numerically demonstrated.
Decision consistency in human decision-making tasks and in recruiting empirical
data are evaluated based on local reservoir. In summary, the proposed local
reservoir model paves a path toward establishing a foundation for computational

lies in their ability to preserve more information about the input by replacing
max-pooling layers with convolutional strides and dynamic routing, allowing for
preservation of part-whole relationships in the data. This preservation of the

vectors. Our work expands the use of capsule networks to the task of object

phase. During the sensing phase, the user is able to sense a subset of channels
sequentially before it decides to use one of them in the following transmission
phase. We assume the channel states alternate between busy and idle according
to independent Bernoulli random processes from frame to frame. To capture the
inherent uncertainty in channel sensing, we assume the reward of each
transmission when the channel is idle is a random variable. We also associate
random costs with sensing and transmission actions. Our objective is to
understand how the costs and reward of the actions would affect the optimal
behavior of the user in both offline and online settings, and design the
corresponding opportunistic spectrum access strategies to maximize the expected
cumulative net reward (i.e., reward-minus-cost). We start with an offline
setting where the statistics of the channel status, costs and reward are known
beforehand. We show that the the optimal policy exhibits a recursive double
threshold structure, and the user needs to compare the channel statistics with
those thresholds sequentially in order to decide its actions. With such
insights, we then study the online setting, where the statistical information
of the channels, costs and reward are unknown a priori. We judiciously balance
exploration and exploitation, and show that the cumulative regret scales in
O(log T). We also establish a matched lower bound, which implies that our
online algorithm is order-optimal. Simulation results corroborate our
theoretical analysis.","['Chao Gan', 'Ruida Zhou', 'Jing Yang', 'Cong Shen']","['cs.NI', 'cs.IT', 'cs.LG', 'math.IT', 'stat.ML']",2018-04-11 15:28:07+00:00
