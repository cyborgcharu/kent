communities for decades, which has led to the design of many algorithms, some
of which are now considered references (such as t-SNE for example). In our era
of overwhelming data volumes, the scalability of such methods have become more
and more important. In this work, we present a method which allows to apply any
visualization or embedding algorithm on very large datasets by considering only
a fraction of the data as input and then extending the information to all data
points using a graph encoding its global similarity. We show that in most
cases, using only $\mathcal{O}(\log(N))$ samples is sufficient to diffuse the
information to all $N$ data points. In addition, we propose quantitative
methods to measure the quality of embeddings and demonstrate the validity of
our technique on both synthetic and real-world datasets.","['Johan Paratte', 'Nathanaël Perraudin', 'Pierre Vandergheynst']","['cs.LG', 'stat.ML']",2017-02-19 22:59:12+00:00

et al. (2015)) suggest that local minima with high error are exponentially rare
in high dimensions. However, to prove low error guarantees for Multilayer
Neural Networks (MNNs), previous works so far required either a heavily
modified MNN model or training method, strong assumptions on the labels (e.g.,
""near"" linear separability), or an unrealistic hidden layer with
$\Omega\left(N\right)$ units.
  Results: We examine a MNN with one hidden layer of piecewise linear units, a
single output, and a quadratic loss. We prove that, with high probability in
the limit of $N\rightarrow\infty$ datapoints, the volume of differentiable
regions of the empiric loss containing sub-optimal differentiable local minima
is exponentially vanishing in comparison with the same volume of global minima,
given standard normal input of dimension
$d_{0}=\tilde{\Omega}\left(\sqrt{N}\right)$, and a more realistic number of
$d_{1}=\tilde{\Omega}\left(N/d_{0}\right)$ hidden units. We demonstrate our
results numerically: for example, $0\%$ binary classification training error on
CIFAR with only $N/d_{0}\approx 16$ hidden neurons.","['Daniel Soudry', 'Elad Hoffer']",['stat.ML'],2017-02-19 18:12:51+00:00

successfully track not only slowly changing subspace but also abruptly changed
subspace. By embedding hypothesis testing into the algorithm, OMWRPCA can
detect change points of the underlying subspaces. Extensive simulation studies

teaching dimension (RTD) and the VC dimension (VCD) of concept classes of
finite sizes. The RTD of a concept class $\mathcal C \subseteq \{0, 1\}^n$,
introduced by Zilles et al. (2011), is a combinatorial complexity measure
characterized by the worst-case number of examples necessary to identify a
concept in $\mathcal C$ according to the recursive teaching model.

$\mathrm{VCD}(\mathcal C)=d$, Simon & Zilles (2015) posed an open problem
$\mathrm{RTD}(\mathcal C) = O(d)$, i.e., is RTD linearly upper bounded by VCD?
Previously, the best known result is an exponential upper bound
$\mathrm{RTD}(\mathcal C) = O(d \cdot 2^d)$, due to Chen et al. (2016). In this
paper, we show a quadratic upper bound: $\mathrm{RTD}(\mathcal C) = O(d^2)$,

http://arxiv.org/abs/1702.05574v3,Sample complexity of population recovery,"The problem of population recovery refers to estimating a distribution based
on incomplete or corrupted samples. Consider a random poll of sample size $n$
conducted on a population of individuals, where each pollee is asked to answer
$d$ binary questions. We consider one of the two polling impediments: (a) in
lossy population recovery, a pollee may skip each question with probability
$\epsilon$, (b) in noisy population recovery, a pollee may lie on each question
with probability $\epsilon$. Given $n$ lossy or noisy samples, the goal is to
estimate the probabilities of all $2^d$ binary vectors simultaneously within
accuracy $\delta$ with high probability.
  This paper settles the sample complexity of population recovery. For lossy
model, the optimal sample complexity is
$\tilde\Theta(\delta^{-2\max\{\frac{\epsilon}{1-\epsilon},1\}})$, improving the
state of the art by Moitra and Saks in several ways: a lower bound is
established, the upper bound is improved and the result depends at most on the
logarithm of the dimension. Surprisingly, the sample complexity undergoes a
phase transition from parametric to nonparametric rate when $\epsilon$ exceeds
$1/2$. For noisy population recovery, the sharp sample complexity turns out to
be more sensitive to dimension and scales as $\exp(\Theta(d^{1/3}
\log^{2/3}(1/\delta)))$ except for the trivial cases of $\epsilon=0,1/2$ or
$1$.
  For both models, our estimators simply compute the empirical mean of a
certain function, which is found by pre-solving a linear program (LP).
Curiously, the dual LP can be understood as Le Cam's method for lower-bounding
the minimax risk, thus establishing the statistical optimality of the proposed
estimators. The value of the LP is determined by complex-analytic methods.","['Yury Polyanskiy', 'Ananda Theertha Suresh', 'Yihong Wu']","['math.ST', 'cs.IT', 'math.IT', 'stat.ML', 'stat.TH']",2017-02-18 06:11:25+00:00

domain-specific transformations to synthetically expand a training set, is a
standard tool in supervised learning. While effective in tasks such as visual
recognition, the set of transformations must be carefully designed,
implemented, and tested for every new domain, limiting its re-use and
generality. In this paper, we adopt a simpler, domain-agnostic approach to
dataset augmentation. We start with existing data points and apply simple
transformations such as adding noise, interpolating, or extrapolating between
them. Our main insight is to perform the transformation not in input space, but
in a learned feature space. A re-kindling of interest in unsupervised
representation learning makes this technique timely and more effective. It is a
simple proposal, but to-date one that has not been tested empirically. Working
in the space of context vectors generated by sequence-to-sequence models, we
demonstrate a technique that is effective for both static and sequential data.","['Terrance DeVries', 'Graham W. Taylor']","['stat.ML', 'cs.LG']",2017-02-17 23:13:15+00:00

adversarial multi-armed bandit problem has highlighted the role of the hazard
rate of the distribution generating the perturbations. Assuming that the hazard
rate is bounded, it is possible to provide regret analyses for a variety of
FTPL algorithms for the multi-armed bandit problem. This paper pushes the
inquiry into regret bounds for FTPL algorithms beyond the bounded hazard rate
condition. There are good reasons to do so: natural distributions such as the
uniform and Gaussian violate the condition. We give regret bounds for both
bounded support and unbounded support distributions without assuming the hazard
rate condition. We also disprove a conjecture that the Gaussian distribution
cannot lead to a low-regret algorithm. In fact, it turns out that it leads to
near optimal regret, up to logarithmic factors. A key ingredient in our
approach is the introduction of a new notion called the generalized hazard

http://arxiv.org/abs/1702.05471v2,Maximally Correlated Principal Component Analysis,"In the era of big data, reducing data dimensionality is critical in many
areas of science. Widely used Principal Component Analysis (PCA) addresses this
problem by computing a low dimensional data embedding that maximally explain
variance of the data. However, PCA has two major weaknesses. Firstly, it only
considers linear correlations among variables (features), and secondly it is
not suitable for categorical data. We resolve these issues by proposing
Maximally Correlated Principal Component Analysis (MCPCA). MCPCA computes
transformations of variables whose covariance matrix has the largest Ky Fan
norm. Variable transformations are unknown, can be nonlinear and are computed
in an optimization. MCPCA can also be viewed as a multivariate extension of
Maximal Correlation. For jointly Gaussian variables we show that the covariance
matrix corresponding to the identity (or the negative of the identity)
transformations majorizes covariance matrices of non-identity functions. Using
this result we characterize global MCPCA optimizers for nonlinear functions of
jointly Gaussian variables for every rank constraint. For categorical variables
we characterize global MCPCA optimizers for the rank one constraint based on
the leading eigenvector of a matrix computed using pairwise joint
distributions. For a general rank constraint we propose a block coordinate
descend algorithm and show its convergence to stationary points of the MCPCA
optimization. We compare MCPCA with PCA and other state-of-the-art
dimensionality reduction methods including Isomap, LLE, multilayer autoencoders
(neural networks), kernel PCA, probabilistic PCA and diffusion maps on several
synthetic and real datasets. We show that MCPCA consistently provides improved

block variables to update and establishes an $O(1/t)$ convergence rate under
weak convexity assumption. We show that the rate can be accelerated to
$O(1/t^2)$ if the objective is strongly convex. In addition, if one block
variable is independent of the others in the objective, we then show that the
algorithm can be modified to achieve a linear rate of convergence. The

records %from the UC San Diego Health System, from a large United States health
system we demonstrate potential improvements on the order of 20% (in terms of
minutes overbooked) compared to current scheduling techniques. Moreover, we
demonstrate that surgery durations are indeed heteroscedastic. We show that
models that estimate case-specific uncertainty better fit the data (log
likelihood). Additionally, we show that the heteroscedastic predictions can

observations is fundamental in many areas of science and engineering. The most
well-known method, the Kalman smoother (and the related Kalman filter), relies
on assumptions of linearity and Gaussianity that are rarely met in practice. In
this paper, we introduced a new dynamical smoothing method that exploits the
remarkable capabilities of convolutional neural networks to approximate complex
non-linear functions. The main idea is to generate a training set composed of
both latent states and observations from an ensemble of simulators and to train
the deep network to recover the former from the latter. Importantly, this
method only requires the availability of the simulators and can therefore be
applied in situations in which either the latent dynamical model or the
observation model cannot be easily expressed in closed form. In our simulation
studies, we show that the resulting ConvNet smoother has almost optimal
performance in the Gaussian case even when the parameters are unknown.
Furthermore, the method can be successfully applied to extremely non-linear and

difficult it is to distinguish a good sampling strategy from a bad one given
the limited amount of data collected up to any given time. This change of
perspective allows us to match the strength of both Fano and change-of-measure

concreteness, we apply our techniques to a structured multi-arm bandit problem

entries. Related approaches have found considerable success in the area of
recommender systems, under machine learning. From a statistical estimation
point of view, the gold standard is to have access to the joint probability
distribution of all pertinent random variables, from which any desired optimal
estimator can be readily derived. In practice high-dimensional joint
distributions are very hard to estimate, and only estimates of low-dimensional
projections may be available. We show that it is possible to identify
higher-order joint PMFs from lower-order marginalized PMFs using coupled
low-rank tensor factorization. Our approach features guaranteed identifiability
when the full joint PMF is of low-enough rank, and effective approximation
otherwise. We provide an algorithmic approach to compute the sought factors,

data-points has generated a tremendous interest recently. A recurring theme of
these problems is that only a few labels are active in any given datapoint as
compared to the total number of labels. However, only a small number of
existing work take direct advantage of this inherent extreme sparsity in the
label space. By the virtue of Restricted Isometry Property (RIP), satisfied by
many random ensembles, we propose a novel procedure for multilabel learning
known as RIPML. During the training phase, in RIPML, labels are projected onto
a random low-dimensional subspace followed by solving a least-square problem in
this subspace. Inference is done by a k-nearest neighbor (kNN) based approach.
We demonstrate the effectiveness of RIPML by conducting extensive simulations

results in $k$th degree piecewise polynomial components, (e.g., $k=0$ gives
piecewise constant components, $k=1$ gives piecewise linear, $k=2$ gives
piecewise quadratic, etc.). Analogous to its advantages in the univariate case,
additive trend filtering has favorable theoretical and computational
properties, thanks in large part to the localized nature of the (discrete)
total variation regularizer that it uses. On the theory side, we derive fast
error rates for additive trend filtering estimates, and show these rates are
minimax optimal when the underlying function is additive and has component
functions whose derivatives are of bounded variation. We also show that these
rates are unattainable by additive smoothing splines (and by additive models
built from linear smoothers, in general). On the computational side, as per the
standard in additive models, backfitting is an appealing method for
optimization, but it is particularly appealing for additive trend filtering
because we can leverage a few highly efficient univariate trend filtering
solvers. Going one step further, we describe a new backfitting algorithm whose

are used in a L1-regularized regression. We modify RuleFit by replacing the
L1-regularization by a horseshoe prior, which is well known to give aggressive
shrinkage of noise predictor while leaving the important signal essentially
untouched. This is especially important when a large number of rules are used
as predictors as many of them only contribute noise. Our horseshoe prior has an
additional hierarchical layer that applies more shrinkage a priori to rules
with a large number of splits, and to rules that are only satisfied by a few
observations. The aggressive noise shrinkage of our prior also makes it
possible to complement the rules from boosting in Friedman and Popescu (2008)
with an additional set of trees from random forest, which brings a desirable
diversity to the ensemble. We sample from the posterior distribution using a
very efficient and easily implemented Gibbs sampler. The new model is shown to
outperform state-of-the-art methods like RuleFit, BART and random forest on 16

particularly when it comes to clustering tasks that impose on strong structural
assumptions. This work presents an unsupervised method for assessing similarity
in bipartite data. Similar to some co-clustering methods, the method is based
on regular equivalence in graphs. The algorithm uses spectral properties of a
bipartite adjacency matrix to estimate similarity in both dimensions. The
method is reflexive in that similarity in one dimension is used to inform
similarity in the other. Reflexive regular equivalence can also use the
structure of transitivities -- in a network sense -- the contribution of which
is controlled by the algorithm's only free-parameter, $\alpha$. The method is
completely unsupervised and can be used to validate assumptions of
co-similarity, which are required but often untested, in co-clustering
analyses. Three variants of the method with different normalizations are tested
on synthetic data. The method is found to be robust to noise and well-suited to
asymmetric co-similar structure, making it particularly informative for cluster
analysis and recommendation in bipartite data of unknown structure. In
experiments, the convergence and speed of the algorithm are found to be stable

and Hessian sketch used to approximately solve the Matrix Ridge Regression
(MRR) problem. Prior research has quantified the effects of classical sketch on
the strictly simpler least squares regression (LSR) problem. We establish that
classical sketch has a similar effect upon the optimization properties of MRR
as it does on those of LSR: namely, it recovers nearly optimal solutions. By
contrast, Hessian sketch does not have this guarantee, instead, the
approximation error is governed by a subtle interplay between the ""mass"" in the
responses and the optimal objective value.
  For both types of approximation, the regularization in the sketched MRR
problem results in significantly different statistical properties from those of
the sketched LSR problem. In particular, there is a bias-variance trade-off in
sketched MRR that is not present in sketched LSR. We provide upper and lower
bounds on the bias and variance of sketched MRR, these bounds show that
classical sketch significantly increases the variance, while Hessian sketch
significantly increases the bias. Empirically, sketched MRR solutions can have
risks that are higher by an order-of-magnitude than those of the optimal MRR
solutions.
  We establish theoretically and empirically that model averaging greatly
decreases the gap between the risks of the true and sketched solutions to the
MRR problem. Thus, in parallel or distributed settings, sketching combined with
model averaging is a powerful technique that quickly obtains near-optimal
solutions to the MRR problem while greatly mitigating the increased statistical

While understandable, relying on intuition over models has often been found to
result in inferior outcomes. Here we present a new method,
select-regress-and-round, for constructing simple rules that perform well for
complex decisions. These rules take the form of a weighted checklist, can be
applied mentally, and nonetheless rival the performance of modern machine
learning algorithms. Our method for creating these rules is itself simple, and
can be carried out by practitioners with basic statistics knowledge. We
demonstrate this technique with a detailed case study of judicial decisions to
release or detain defendants while they await trial. In this application, as in
many policy settings, the effects of proposed decision rules cannot be directly
observed from historical data: if a rule recommends releasing a defendant that
the judge in reality detained, we do not observe what would have happened under
the proposed action. We address this key counterfactual estimation problem by
drawing on tools from causal inference. We find that simple rules significantly
outperform judges and are on par with decisions derived from random forests
trained on all available features. Generalizing to 22 varied decision-making
domains, we find this basic result replicates. We conclude with an analytical

Improvements of this technology allow to describe millions of individual cells

parameters. By combining these two ideas we develop Inference Gradients, a
simple, fast, and robust method for practical learning of PSRs. Inference
Gradients performs gradient descent in the PSR parameter space to optimize an

completion, applied on biological data sets to be used for classification task.
We first introduced an objective function that will be minimized by exploiting

more important but more challenging. When observations are hierarchically
clustered the problem is even more challenging because model selection with
mixed effect models can produce misleading results when nonlinear effects are
not included into the model (Bauer and Cai, 2009). A machine learning method
called boosted decision trees (Friedman, 2001) is a good approach for
exploratory regression analysis in real data sets because it can detect
predictors with nonlinear and interaction effects while also accounting for
missing data. We propose an extension to boosted decision decision trees called
metboost for hierarchically clustered data. It works by constraining the
structure of each tree to be the same across groups, but allowing the terminal
node means to differ. This allows predictors and split points to lead to
different predictions within each group, and approximates nonlinear group
specific effects. Importantly, metboost remains computationally feasible for
thousands of observations and hundreds of predictors that may contain missing
values. We apply the method to predict math performance for 15,240 students
from 751 schools in data collected in the Educational Longitudinal Study 2002
(Ingels et al., 2007), allowing 76 predictors to have unique effects for each
school. When comparing results to boosted decision trees, metboost has 15%
improved prediction performance. Results of a large simulation study show that
metboost has up to 70% improved variable selection performance and up to 30%
improved prediction performance compared to boosted decision trees when group

biometry, and owing to its time-consuming process, there has been a great
demand for automatic estimation. However, the automated analysis of ultrasound
images is complicated because they are patient-specific, operator-dependent,
and machine-specific. Among various types of fetal biometry, the accurate
estimation of abdominal circumference (AC) is especially difficult to perform
automatically because the abdomen has low contrast against surroundings,
non-uniform contrast, and irregular shape compared to other parameters.We
propose a method for the automatic estimation of the fetal AC from 2D
ultrasound data through a specially designed convolutional neural network
(CNN), which takes account of doctors' decision process, anatomical structure,
and the characteristics of the ultrasound image. The proposed method uses CNN
to classify ultrasound images (stomach bubble, amniotic fluid, and umbilical
vein) and Hough transformation for measuring AC. We test the proposed method
using clinical ultrasound data acquired from 56 pregnant women. Experimental
results show that, with relatively small training samples, the proposed CNN
provides sufficient classification results for AC estimation through the Hough
transformation. The proposed method automatically estimates AC from ultrasound

related tasks (large $K$) under a high-dimensional (large $p$) situation is an
important task. Most previous studies for the joint estimation of multiple

scale. As the first study of joint sGGM using the Elementary Estimator
framework, our work has three major contributions: (1) We solve FASJEM through
an entry-wise manner which is parallelizable. (2) We choose a proximal
algorithm to optimize FASJEM. This improves the computational efficiency from
$O(Kp^3)$ to $O(Kp^2)$ and reduces the memory requirement from $O(Kp^2)$ to
$O(K)$. (3) We theoretically prove that FASJEM achieves a consistent estimation
with a convergence rate of $O(\log(Kp)/n_{tot})$. On several synthetic and four
real-world datasets, FASJEM shows significant improvements over baselines on

statistics has focused on settings which involve fully-observed data, settings
with missing values and corruptions are common in practice. We consider the
problems of estimation and of constructing component-wise confidence intervals
in a sparse high-dimensional linear regression model when some covariates of
the design matrix are missing completely at random. We analyze a variant of the
Dantzig selector [9] for estimating the regression model and we use a
de-biasing argument to construct component-wise confidence intervals. Our first
main result is to establish upper bounds on the estimation error as a function
of the model parameters (the sparsity level s, the expected fraction of
observed covariates $\rho_*$, and a measure of the signal strength
$\|\beta^*\|_2$). We find that even in an idealized setting where the
covariates are assumed to be missing completely at random, somewhat
surprisingly and in contrast to the fully-observed setting, there is a
dichotomy in the dependence on model parameters and much faster rates are
obtained if the covariance matrix of the random design is known. To study this
issue further, our second main contribution is to provide lower bounds on the
estimation error showing that this discrepancy in rates is unavoidable in a
minimax sense. We then consider the problem of high-dimensional inference in
the presence of missing data. We construct and analyze confidence intervals
using a de-biased estimator. In the presence of missing data, inference is
complicated by the fact that the de-biasing matrix is correlated with the pilot
estimator and this necessitates the design of a new estimator and a novel
analysis. We also complement our mathematical study with extensive simulations
on synthetic and semi-synthetic data that show the accuracy of our asymptotic
predictions for finite sample sizes.","['Yining Wang', 'Jialei Wang', 'Sivaraman Balakrishnan', 'Aarti Singh']","['stat.ML', 'cs.LG', 'stat.ME']",2017-02-09 03:10:13+00:00
