http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.10238v1,Hypothesis Testing for Class-Conditional Noise Using Local Maximum Likelihood,"In supervised learning, automatically assessing the quality of the labels
before any learning takes place remains an open research question. In certain
particular cases, hypothesis testing procedures have been proposed to assess
whether a given instance-label dataset is contaminated with class-conditional
label noise, as opposed to uniform label noise. The existing theory builds on
the asymptotic properties of the Maximum Likelihood Estimate for parametric
logistic regression. However, the parametric assumptions on top of which these
approaches are constructed are often too strong and unrealistic in practice. To
alleviate this problem, in this paper we propose an alternative path by showing
how similar procedures can be followed when the underlying model is a product
of Local Maximum Likelihood Estimation that leads to more flexible
nonparametric logistic regression models, which in turn are less susceptible to
model misspecification. This different view allows for wider applicability of
the tests by offering users access to a richer model class. Similarly to
existing works, we assume we have access to anchor points which are provided by
the users. We introduce the necessary ingredients for the adaptation of the
hypothesis tests to the case of nonparametric logistic regression and
empirically compare against the parametric approach presenting both synthetic
and real-world case studies and discussing the advantages and limitations of
the proposed approach.","['Weisong Yang', 'Rafael Poyiadzi', 'Niall Twomey', 'Raul Santos Rodriguez']","['cs.LG', 'stat.ML']",2023-12-15 22:14:58+00:00
http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.10234v1,Targeted Machine Learning for Average Causal Effect Estimation Using the Front-Door Functional,"Evaluating the average causal effect (ACE) of a treatment on an outcome often
involves overcoming the challenges posed by confounding factors in
observational studies. A traditional approach uses the back-door criterion,
seeking adjustment sets to block confounding paths between treatment and
outcome. However, this method struggles with unmeasured confounders. As an
alternative, the front-door criterion offers a solution, even in the presence
of unmeasured confounders between treatment and outcome. This method relies on
identifying mediators that are not directly affected by these confounders and
that completely mediate the treatment's effect. Here, we introduce novel
estimation strategies for the front-door criterion based on the targeted
minimum loss-based estimation theory. Our estimators work across diverse
scenarios, handling binary, continuous, and multivariate mediators. They
leverage data-adaptive machine learning algorithms, minimizing assumptions and
ensuring key statistical properties like asymptotic linearity,
double-robustness, efficiency, and valid estimates within the target parameter
space. We establish conditions under which the nuisance functional estimations
ensure the root n-consistency of ACE estimators. Our numerical experiments show
the favorable finite sample performance of the proposed estimators. We
demonstrate the applicability of these estimators to analyze the effect of
early stage academic performance on future yearly income using data from the

unknown stochastic dynamical system from its trajectory data. The method seeks
to approximate the unknown flow map of the underlying system. It employs the
idea of autoencoder to identify the unobserved latent random variables. In our
approach, we design an encoding function to discover the latent variables,
which are modeled as unit Gaussian, and a decoding function to reconstruct the
future states of the system. Both the encoder and decoder are expressed as deep
neural networks (DNNs). Once the DNNs are trained by the trajectory data, the
decoder serves as a predictive model for the unknown stochastic system. Through
an extensive set of numerical examples, we demonstrate that the method is able
to produce long-term system predictions by using short bursts of trajectory
data. It is also applicable to systems driven by non-Gaussian noises.","['Zhongshu Xu', 'Yuan Chen', 'Qifan Chen', 'Dongbin Xiu']","['cs.LG', 'cs.NA', 'math.NA', 'stat.ML', '60H10, 60H35, 62M45, 65C30']",2023-12-15 18:19:22+00:00

given to loss values to mitigate the gap between the source and the target
distribution. However, estimating the optimal weights typically involves
computationally expensive matrix inversion and hyper-parameter tuning. In this
paper, we propose a new covariate shift adaptation method which avoids
estimating the weights. The basic idea is to directly work on unlabeled target
data, labeled according to the $k$-nearest neighbors in the source dataset. Our
analysis reveals that setting $k = 1$ is an optimal choice. This property
removes the necessity of tuning the only hyper-parameter $k$ and leads to a
running time quasi-linear in the sample size. Our results include sharp rates
of convergence for our estimator, with a tight control of the mean square error
and explicit constants. In particular, the variance of our estimators has the
same rate of convergence as for standard parametric estimation despite their
non-parametric nature. The proposed estimator shares similarities with some
matching-based treatment effect estimators used, e.g., in biostatistics,
econometrics, and epidemiology. Our experiments show that it achieves drastic
reduction in the running time with remarkable accuracy.","['François Portier', 'Lionel Truquet', 'Ikko Yamane']","['stat.ML', 'cs.LG']",2023-12-15 17:28:09+00:00

applicability to a diverse range of real-world sequential decision-making

levels, effectively balancing constraint satisfaction against performance. To
demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, we first compare it against
state-of-the-art baseline methods in a synthetic environment, highlighting the
impact of intrinsic environmental noise across different risk configurations.
Finally, we evaluate our framework in a real-world use case involving a 5G

http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09940v2,Sketch and shift: a robust decoder for compressive clustering,"Compressive learning is an emerging approach to drastically reduce the memory
footprint of large-scale learning, by first summarizing a large dataset into a
low-dimensional sketch vector, and then decoding from this sketch the latent
information needed for learning. In light of recent progress on information
preservation guarantees for sketches based on random features, a major
objective is to design easy-to-tune algorithms (called decoders) to robustly
and efficiently extract this information. To address the underlying non-convex
optimization problems, various heuristics have been proposed. In the case of
compressive clustering, the standard heuristic is CL-OMPR, a variant of sliding
Frank-Wolfe. Yet, CL-OMPR is hard to tune, and the examination of its
robustness was overlooked. In this work, we undertake a scrutinized examination
of CL-OMPR to circumvent its limitations. In particular, we show how this
algorithm can fail to recover the clusters even in advantageous scenarios. To
gain insight, we show how the deficiencies of this algorithm can be attributed
to optimization difficulties related to the structure of a correlation function
appearing at core steps of the algorithm. To address these limitations, we
propose an alternative decoder offering substantial improvements over CL-OMPR.
Its design is notably inspired from the mean shift algorithm, a classic
approach to detect the local maxima of kernel density estimators. The proposed
algorithm can extract clustering information from a sketch of the MNIST dataset
that is 10 times smaller than previously.","['Ayoub Belhadji', 'Rémi Gribonval']","['cs.LG', 'stat.ML']",2023-12-15 16:53:55+00:00

challenging task, yet essential for a correct definition of cardiac digital
twins for precision cardiology. Here, we propose a probabilistic approach for
identifying the Purkinje network from non-invasive clinical data such as the
standard electrocardiogram (ECG). We use cardiac imaging to build an
anatomically accurate model of the ventricles; we algorithmically generate a
rule-based Purkinje network tailored to the anatomy; we simulate physiological
electrocardiograms with a fast model; we identify the geometrical and
electrical parameters of the Purkinje-ECG model with Bayesian optimization and
approximate Bayesian computation. The proposed approach is inherently
probabilistic and generates a population of plausible Purkinje networks, all
fitting the ECG within a given tolerance. In this way, we can estimate the
uncertainty of the parameters, thus providing reliable predictions. We test our
methodology in physiological and pathological scenarios, showing that we are
able to accurately recover the ECG with our model. We propagate the uncertainty

mixtures of experts (MoE) models with an aggregation strategy to construct a
reduction estimator from local estimators fitted parallelly to distributed

reduction estimator is consistent as soon as the local estimators to be
aggregated are consistent, and its construction is performed by a proposed
majorization-minimization (MM) algorithm that is computationally effective. We
study the statistical and numerical properties for the proposed reduction
estimator on experiments that demonstrate its performance compared to namely
the global estimator constructed in a centralized way from the full dataset.

Bayesian FL methods which collect parameter samples from local posteriors, and
aggregate them to approximate the global posterior. To improve scalability for
larger models, one common Bayesian approach is to approximate the global
predictive posterior by multiplying local predictive posteriors. In this work,
we demonstrate that this method gives systematically overconfident predictions,

posteriors, using a tunable parameter $\beta$. This parameter is tuned to
improve the global ensemble's calibration, before it is distilled to a single

RNNs, these stability conditions can be expressed in terms of conditions on the
weights. We assume the processes involved are essentially bounded and the loss
functions are Lipschitz. The proposed bound on the generalisation gap depends
on the mixing coefficient of the data distribution, and the essential supremum
of the data. Furthermore, the bound converges to zero as the dataset size

is material too, namely, users' preferences for the site over other sites,
since that shows users' base level propensities to engage with the site.
Estimating users' preferences for the site, however, faces major obstacles
because (a) the focal site usually has no data of its users' interactions with
other sites; these interactions are users' unobserved behaviors for the focal
site; and (b) the Machine Learning literature in recommendation does not offer
a model of this situation. Even if (b) is resolved, the problem in (a) persists
since without access to data of its users' interactions with other sites, there
is no ground truth for evaluation. Moreover, it is most useful when (c) users'

Such higher-order domains are typically modeled either as hypergraphs, or as
simplicial, cubical or other cell complexes. In this context, cell complexes
are often seen as a subclass of hypergraphs with additional algebraic structure
that can be exploited, e.g., to develop a spectral theory. In this article, we
promote an alternative perspective. We argue that hypergraphs and cell
complexes emphasize \emph{different} types of relations, which may have
different utility depending on the application context. Whereas hypergraphs are
effective in modeling set-type, multi-body relations between entities, cell
complexes provide an effective means to model hierarchical,
interior-to-boundary type relations. We discuss the relative advantages of

is a type of structural causal model where the cause can contribute to both the

To address this limitation, we propose a novel approach to estimating this

accounting for sampling variability with smaller sample sizes and extreme

bound on the prediction error in terms of the distance between the training
points and a testing point, the posterior variance, and the level of change in
the spreading process, and we assess how the characteristics of the epidemic
spread and infection data influence this error bound. We present examples that
use GPR to model and predict epidemic spread by using real-world infection data
gathered in the UK during the COVID-19 epidemic. These examples illustrate
that, under typical conditions, the prediction for the next twenty days has
94.29% of the noisy data located within the 95% confidence interval, validating

multi-label text classification and present a novel approach for addressing the
computational inefficiency of the Label Powerset (LP) ICP, arrising when
dealing with a high number of unique labels. We present experimental results
using the original and the proposed efficient LP-ICP on two English and one
Czech language data-sets. Specifically, we apply the LP-ICP on three deep
Artificial Neural Network (ANN) classifiers of two types: one based on
contextualised (bert) and two on non-contextualised (word2vec) word-embeddings.
In the LP-ICP setting we assign nonconformity scores to label-sets from which
the corresponding p-values and prediction-sets are determined. Our approach
deals with the increased computational burden of LP by eliminating from
consideration a significant number of label-sets that will surely have p-values
below the specified significance level. This reduces dramatically the
computational complexity of the approach while fully respecting the standard CP
guarantees. Our experimental results show that the contextualised-based
classifier surpasses the non-contextualised-based ones and obtains
state-of-the-art performance for all data-sets examined. The good performance
of the underlying classifiers is carried on to their ICP counterparts without
any significant accuracy loss, but with the added benefits of ICP, i.e. the
confidence information encapsulated in the prediction sets. We experimentally
demonstrate that the resulting prediction sets can be tight enough to be
practically useful even though the set of all possible label-sets contains more
than $1e+16$ combinations. Additionally, the empirical error rates of the
obtained prediction-sets confirm that our outputs are well-calibrated.","['Lysimachos Maltoudoglou', 'Andreas Paisios', 'Ladislav Lenc', 'Jiří Martínek', 'Pavel Král', 'Harris Papadopoulos']","['cs.LG', 'cs.CL', 'stat.ML']",2023-12-14 19:17:42+00:00

called bifurcations, when their underlying parameters cross a threshold.
Existing methods predict oncoming catastrophes in individual systems but are

dynamical regimes across diverse systems and to generalize to real data. To
address this challenge, we propose a data-driven, physically-informed
deep-learning framework for classifying dynamical regimes and characterizing

bifurcation, which is used to model periodic dynamics across a wide range of
applications. Our convolutional attention method is trained with data
augmentations that encourage the learning of topological invariants which can
be used to detect bifurcation boundaries in unseen systems and to design models
of biological systems like oscillatory gene regulatory networks. We further

proliferation and differentiation dynamics along pancreatic endocrinogenesis

present strong evidence that commonly used models with provable absence of

some classical data from quantum devices during an initial data acquisition

curse of dimensionality, and that current approaches for solving them end up
encoding the problem into some small, classically simulable, subspaces. Thus,
while stressing quantum computers can be essential for collecting data, our

present a world model that learns invariant features using (i) contrastive

an explicit representation of the world dynamics i.e. a world model, improves
sample efficiency while contrastive learning implicitly enforces learning of
invariant features, which improves generalization. However, the na\""ive
integration of contrastive loss to world models is not good enough, as
world-model-based RL methods independently optimize representation learning and

http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.08369v2,The Effective Horizon Explains Deep RL Performance in Stochastic Environments,"Reinforcement learning (RL) theory has largely focused on proving minimax
sample complexity bounds. These require strategic exploration algorithms that
use relatively limited function classes for representing the policy or value
function. Our goal is to explain why deep RL algorithms often perform well in
practice, despite using random exploration and much more expressive function
classes like neural networks. Our work arrives at an explanation by showing
that many stochastic MDPs can be solved by performing only a few steps of value
iteration on the random policy's Q function and then acting greedily. When this
is true, we find that it is possible to separate the exploration and learning
components of RL, making it much easier to analyze. We introduce a new RL
algorithm, SQIRL, that iteratively learns a near-optimal policy by exploring
randomly to collect rollouts and then performing a limited number of steps of
fitted-Q iteration over those rollouts. Any regression algorithm that satisfies
basic in-distribution generalization properties can be used in SQIRL to
efficiently solve common MDPs. This can explain why deep RL works, since it is
empirically established that neural networks generalize well in-distribution.
Furthermore, SQIRL explains why random exploration works well in practice. We
leverage SQIRL to derive instance-dependent sample complexity bounds for RL
that are exponential only in an ""effective horizon"" of lookahead and on the
complexity of the class used for function approximation. Empirically, we also
find that SQIRL performance strongly correlates with PPO and DQN performance in
a variety of stochastic environments, supporting that our theoretical analysis
is predictive of practical performance. Our code and data are available at

http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.08358v2,Distributional Preference Learning: Understanding and Accounting for Hidden Context in RLHF,"In practice, preference learning from human feedback depends on incomplete
data with hidden context. Hidden context refers to data that affects the
feedback received, but which is not represented in the data used to train a
preference model. This captures common issues of data collection, such as
having human annotators with varied preferences, cognitive processes that
result in seemingly irrational behavior, and combining data labeled according
to different criteria. We prove that standard applications of preference
learning, including reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF),
implicitly aggregate over hidden contexts according to a well-known voting rule
called Borda count. We show this can produce counter-intuitive results that are
very different from other methods which implicitly aggregate via expected
utility. Furthermore, our analysis formalizes the way that preference learning
from users with diverse values tacitly implements a social choice function. A
key implication of this result is that annotators have an incentive to
misreport their preferences in order to influence the learned model, leading to
vulnerabilities in the deployment of RLHF. As a step towards mitigating these
problems, we introduce a class of methods called distributional preference
learning (DPL). DPL methods estimate a distribution of possible score values
for each alternative in order to better account for hidden context.
Experimental results indicate that applying DPL to RLHF for LLM chatbots
identifies hidden context in the data and significantly reduces subsequent
jailbreak vulnerability. Our code and data are available at

recognizing that the progress from \cite{Stojnictcmspnncaprdt23} is therefore
promising, but yet without a complete concretization, we then proceed by

challenging to handle for large-scale data, as they need to access and process

introducing Gaussian distribution in the SPD space to estimate $E(X|y)$.
Moreover, our model is able to estimate $p(X)$ unconditionally and flexibly
without giving $y$. On the one hand, the model conditionally learns $p(X|y)$
and utilizes the mean of samples to obtain $E(X|y)$ as a prediction. On the
other hand, the model unconditionally learns the probability distribution of
the data $p(X)$ and generates samples that conform to this distribution.
Furthermore, we propose a new SPD net which is much deeper than the previous

propose a cost-based correction to the sampling strategy--the Upper Confidence

probabilistic model relating a latent variable $\Theta \in \Omega \subset
\mathbb{R}^m \; (m\ge 1)$ and an observation $Z \in \mathbb{R}^d$ according to:
$Z \mid \Theta \sim p(\cdot\mid \Theta)$ and $\Theta \sim G^*$, and the goal is
to construct a map to recover the latent variable from the observation. The
posterior mean, a natural candidate for estimating $\Theta$ from $Z$, attains
the minimum Bayes risk (under the squared error loss) but at the expense of
over-shrinking the $Z$, and in general may fail to capture the geometric
features of the prior distribution $G^*$ (e.g., low dimensionality,
discreteness, sparsity, etc.). To rectify these drawbacks, we take a new
perspective on this denoising problem that is inspired by optimal transport
(OT) theory and use it to study a different, OT-based, denoiser at the
population level setting. We rigorously prove that, under general assumptions
on the model, this OT-based denoiser is mathematically well-defined and unique,
and is closely connected to the solution to a Monge OT problem. We then prove
that, under appropriate identifiability assumptions on the model, the OT-based
denoiser can be recovered solely from information of the marginal distribution
of $Z$ and the posterior mean of the model, after solving a linear relaxation
problem over a suitable space of couplings that is reminiscent of standard
multimarginal OT problems. In particular, thanks to Tweedie's formula, when the
likelihood model $\{ p(\cdot \mid \theta) \}_{\theta \in \Omega}$ is an
exponential family of distributions, the OT based-denoiser can be recovered
solely from the marginal distribution of $Z$. In general, our family of OT-like
relaxations is of interest in its own right and for the denoising problem
suggests alternative numerical methods inspired by the rich literature on
computational OT.","['Nicolas Garcia Trillos', 'Bodhisattva Sen']","['math.ST', 'cs.LG', 'math.OC', 'stat.ML', 'stat.TH']",2023-12-13 13:36:32+00:00

practical applications, still faces specific theoretical challenges. In
particular, establishing convergence properties for the standard fixed-point
approach when both the distribution mean and the scatter (or the precision)
matrix are unknown is still an open problem. In robust estimation, imposing
classical constraints on the precision matrix, such as sparsity, has been
limited by the non-convexity of the resulting cost function. This paper tackles
these issues from an optimization viewpoint by proposing a convex formulation
with well-established convergence properties. We embed our analysis in a noisy
scenario where robustness is induced by modelling multiplicative perturbations.
The resulting framework is flexible as it combines a variety of regularizations
for the precision matrix, the mean and model perturbations. This paper presents
proof of the desired theoretical properties, specifies the conditions
preserving these properties for different regularization choices and designs a
general proximal primal-dual optimization strategy. The experiments show a more

directly applicable to wide networks since they do not have unique minima, we

predictions surprisingly makes the loss satisfy QG with unique minima. Based on
such a perturbed prediction, we show a ${\mathcal{O}}(\log T)$ regret for
online regression with both squared loss and KL loss, and subsequently convert
these respectively to $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(\sqrt{KT})$ and
$\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(\sqrt{KL^*} + K)$ regret for NeuCB, where $L^*$ is the

http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06478v3,Prediction De-Correlated Inference: A safe approach for post-prediction inference,"In modern data analysis, it is common to use machine learning methods to
predict outcomes on unlabeled datasets and then use these pseudo-outcomes in
subsequent statistical inference. Inference in this setting is often called
post-prediction inference. We propose a novel assumption-lean framework for
statistical inference under post-prediction setting, called Prediction
De-Correlated Inference (PDC). Our approach is safe, in the sense that PDC can
automatically adapt to any black-box machine-learning model and consistently
outperform the supervised counterparts. The PDC framework also offers easy
extensibility for accommodating multiple predictive models. Both numerical
results and real-world data analysis demonstrate the superiority of PDC over
the state-of-the-art methods.","['Feng Gan', 'Wanfeng Liang', 'Changliang Zou']","['stat.ME', 'stat.ML']",2023-12-11 16:04:48+00:00
http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06403v3,A Robust Mixed-Effects Bandit Algorithm for Assessing Mobile Health Interventions,"Mobile health leverages personalized, contextually-tailored interventions
optimized through bandit and reinforcement learning algorithms. Despite its
promise, challenges like participant heterogeneity, nonstationarity, and
nonlinearity in rewards hinder algorithm performance. We propose a robust
contextual bandit algorithm, termed ""DML-TS-NNR"", that simultaneously addresses
these challenges via (1) modeling the differential reward with user- and
time-specific incidental parameters, (2) network cohesion penalties, and (3)
debiased machine learning for flexible estimation of baseline rewards. We
establish a high-probability regret bound that depends solely on the dimension
of the differential reward model. This feature enables us to achieve robust
regret bounds even when the baseline reward is highly complex. We demonstrate
the superior performance of the DML-TS-NNR algorithm in a simulation and two
off-policy evaluation studies.","['Easton K. Huch', 'Jieru Shi', 'Madeline R. Abbott', 'Jessica R. Golbus', 'Alexander Moreno', 'Walter H. Dempsey']","['stat.ML', 'cs.LG']",2023-12-11 14:24:24+00:00
http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06254v1,Modyn: A Platform for Model Training on Dynamic Datasets With Sample-Level Data Selection,"Machine learning training data is often dynamic in real-world use cases,
i.e., data is added or removed and may experience distribution shifts over
time. Models must incorporate this evolving training data to improve
generalization, adapt to potential distribution shifts, and adhere to privacy
regulations. However, the cost of model (re)training is proportional to how
often the model trains and on how much data it trains on. While ML research
explores these topics in isolation, there is no end-to-end open-source platform
to facilitate the exploration of model retraining and data selection policies
and the deployment these algorithms efficiently at scale.
  We present Modyn, a platform for model training on dynamic datasets that
enables sample-level data selection and triggering policies. Modyn orchestrates
continuous training pipelines while optimizing the underlying system
infrastructure to support fast access to arbitrary data samples for efficient
data selection. Modyn's extensible architecture allows users to run training
pipelines without modifying the platform code, and enables researchers to
effortlessly extend the system. We evaluate Modyn's training throughput,
showing that even in memory-bound recommendation systems workloads, Modyn is
able to reach 80 to 100 % of the throughput compared to loading big chunks of
data locally without sample-level data selection. Additionally, we showcase
Modyn's functionality with three different data selection policies.","['Maximilian Böther', 'Viktor Gsteiger', 'Ties Robroek', 'Ana Klimovic']","['cs.LG', 'cs.AI', 'cs.DB', 'cs.DC', 'stat.ML']",2023-12-11 09:50:52+00:00
http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06219v1,Interpretable Long Term Waypoint-Based Trajectory Prediction Model,"Predicting the future trajectories of dynamic agents in complex environments
is crucial for a variety of applications, including autonomous driving,
robotics, and human-computer interaction. It is a challenging task as the
behavior of the agent is unknown and intrinsically multimodal. Our key insight
is that the agents behaviors are influenced not only by their past trajectories
and their interaction with their immediate environment but also largely with
their long term waypoint (LTW). In this paper, we study the impact of adding a
long-term goal on the performance of a trajectory prediction framework. We
present an interpretable long term waypoint-driven prediction framework
(WayDCM). WayDCM first predict an agent's intermediate goal (IG) by encoding
his interactions with the environment as well as his LTW using a combination of
a Discrete choice Model (DCM) and a Neural Network model (NN). Then, our model
predicts the corresponding trajectories. This is in contrast to previous work
which does not consider the ultimate intent of the agent to predict his
trajectory. We evaluate and show the effectiveness of our approach on the Waymo

http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06091v2,Learning Unknown Intervention Targets in Structural Causal Models from Heterogeneous Data,"We study the problem of identifying the unknown intervention targets in
structural causal models where we have access to heterogeneous data collected
from multiple environments. The unknown intervention targets are the set of
endogenous variables whose corresponding exogenous noises change across the
environments. We propose a two-phase approach which in the first phase recovers
the exogenous noises corresponding to unknown intervention targets whose
distributions have changed across environments. In the second phase, the
recovered noises are matched with the corresponding endogenous variables. For
the recovery phase, we provide sufficient conditions for learning these
exogenous noises up to some component-wise invertible transformation. For the
matching phase, under the causal sufficiency assumption, we show that the
proposed method uniquely identifies the intervention targets. In the presence
of latent confounders, the intervention targets among the observed variables
cannot be determined uniquely. We provide a candidate intervention target set
which is a superset of the true intervention targets. Our approach improves
upon the state of the art as the returned candidate set is always a subset of
the target set returned by previous work. Moreover, we do not require
restrictive assumptions such as linearity of the causal model or performing
invariance tests to learn whether a distribution is changing across
environments which could be highly sample inefficient. Our experimental results
show the effectiveness of our proposed algorithm in practice.","['Yuqin Yang', 'Saber Salehkaleybar', 'Negar Kiyavash']","['cs.LG', 'cs.AI', 'cs.IT', 'math.IT', 'stat.ML']",2023-12-11 03:31:54+00:00
http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06077v1,An Ambiguity Measure for Recognizing the Unknowns in Deep Learning,"We study the understanding of deep neural networks from the scope in which
they are trained on. While the accuracy of these models is usually impressive
on the aggregate level, they still make mistakes, sometimes on cases that
appear to be trivial. Moreover, these models are not reliable in realizing what
they do not know leading to failures such as adversarial vulnerability and
out-of-distribution failures. Here, we propose a measure for quantifying the
ambiguity of inputs for any given model with regard to the scope of its
training. We define the ambiguity based on the geometric arrangements of the
decision boundaries and the convex hull of training set in the feature space
learned by the trained model, and demonstrate that a single ambiguity measure
may detect a considerable portion of mistakes of a model on in-distribution
samples, adversarial inputs, as well as out-of-distribution inputs. Using our
ambiguity measure, a model may abstain from classification when it encounters
ambiguous inputs leading to a better model accuracy not just on a given testing
set, but on the inputs it may encounter at the world at large. In pursuit of
this measure, we develop a theoretical framework that can identify the unknowns
of the model in relation to its scope. We put this in perspective with the
confidence of the model and develop formulations to identify the regions of the
domain which are unknown to the model, yet the model is guaranteed to have high
confidence.",['Roozbeh Yousefzadeh'],"['cs.LG', 'cs.AI', 'stat.ML']",2023-12-11 02:57:12+00:00
http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06071v3,Precipitation Downscaling with Spatiotemporal Video Diffusion,"In climate science and meteorology, high-resolution local precipitation (rain
and snowfall) predictions are limited by the computational costs of
simulation-based methods. Statistical downscaling, or super-resolution, is a
common workaround where a low-resolution prediction is improved using
statistical approaches. Unlike traditional computer vision tasks, weather and
climate applications require capturing the accurate conditional distribution of
high-resolution given low-resolution patterns to assure reliable ensemble
averages and unbiased estimates of extreme events, such as heavy rain. This
work extends recent video diffusion models to precipitation super-resolution,
employing a deterministic downscaler followed by a temporally-conditioned
diffusion model to capture noise characteristics and high-frequency patterns.
We test our approach on FV3GFS output, an established large-scale global
atmosphere model, and compare it against six state-of-the-art baselines. Our
analysis, capturing CRPS, MSE, precipitation distributions, and qualitative
aspects using California and the Himalayas as examples, establishes our method
as a new standard for data-driven precipitation downscaling.","['Prakhar Srivastava', 'Ruihan Yang', 'Gavin Kerrigan', 'Gideon Dresdner', 'Jeremy McGibbon', 'Christopher Bretherton', 'Stephan Mandt']","['cs.CV', 'cs.LG', 'physics.ao-ph', 'stat.ML']",2023-12-11 02:38:07+00:00
