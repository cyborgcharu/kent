constants of feedforward neural networks with ReLU activation functions. We do
so by deriving Lipschitz constants and bounds for ReLU, affine-ReLU, and max
pooling functions, and combining the results to determine a network-wide bound.
Our method uses several insights to obtain tight bounds, such as keeping track
of the zero elements of each layer, and analyzing the composition of affine and
ReLU functions. Furthermore, we employ a careful computational approach which
allows us to apply our method to large networks such as AlexNet and VGG-16. We
present several examples using different networks, which show how our local
Lipschitz bounds are tighter than the global Lipschitz bounds. We also show how
our method can be applied to provide adversarial bounds for classification
networks. These results show that our method produces the largest known bounds
on minimum adversarial perturbations for large networks such as AlexNet and
VGG-16.","['Trevor Avant', 'Kristi A. Morgansen']","['cs.LG', 'stat.ML']",2021-04-29 21:57:47+00:00

applications. However, na\""ive GP realizations require quadratic memory to
store the covariance matrix and cubic computation to perform inference or
evaluate the likelihood function. These bottlenecks have driven much investment
in the development of approximate GP alternatives that scale to the large data
sizes common in modern data-driven applications. We present in this manuscript
MuyGPs, a novel efficient GP hyperparameter estimation method. MuyGPs builds
upon prior methods that take advantage of the nearest neighbors structure of
the data, and uses leave-one-out cross-validation to optimize covariance
(kernel) hyperparameters without realizing a possibly expensive likelihood. We
describe our model and methods in detail, and compare our implementations
against the state-of-the-art competitors in a benchmark spatial statistics
problem. We show that our method outperforms all known competitors both in

quantum computers. However, training VQAs often requires an extensive amount of
time and suffers from the barren plateau problem where the magnitude of the
gradients vanishes with increasing number of qubits. Here, we show how to
optimally train VQAs for learning quantum states. Parameterized quantum
circuits can form Gaussian kernels, which we use to derive adaptive learning
rates for gradient ascent. We introduce the generalized quantum natural
gradient that features stability and optimized movement in parameter space.
Both methods together outperform other optimization routines in training VQAs.
Our methods also excel at numerically optimizing driving protocols for quantum
control problems. The gradients of the VQA do not vanish when the fidelity
between the initial state and the state to be learned is bounded from below. We
identify a VQA for quantum simulation with such a constraint that thus can be
trained free of barren plateaus. Finally, we propose the application of
Gaussian kernels for quantum machine learning.","['Tobias Haug', 'M. S. Kim']","['quant-ph', 'cs.LG', 'stat.ML']",2021-04-29 17:54:59+00:00

multi-attribute data and multi-way interactions, play an indispensable role in
modern data science across various fields in science and engineering. A
fundamental task is to faithfully recover the tensor from highly incomplete
measurements in a statistically and computationally efficient manner.
Harnessing the low-rank structure of tensors in the Tucker decomposition, this
paper develops a scaled gradient descent (ScaledGD) algorithm to directly
recover the tensor factors with tailored spectral initializations, and shows
that it provably converges at a linear rate independent of the condition number
of the ground truth tensor for two canonical problems -- tensor completion and
tensor regression -- as soon as the sample size is above the order of $n^{3/2}$
ignoring other parameter dependencies, where $n$ is the dimension of the
tensor. This leads to an extremely scalable approach to low-rank tensor
estimation compared with prior art, which suffers from at least one of the
following drawbacks: extreme sensitivity to ill-conditioning, high
per-iteration costs in terms of memory and computation, or poor sample
complexity guarantees. To the best of our knowledge, ScaledGD is the first
algorithm that achieves near-optimal statistical and computational complexities
simultaneously for low-rank tensor completion with the Tucker decomposition.
Our algorithm highlights the power of appropriate preconditioning in
accelerating nonconvex statistical estimation, where the iteration-varying
preconditioners promote desirable invariance properties of the trajectory with

high-dimensional and non-convex. For computational reasons, researchers
approximate this posterior using inexpensive mini-batch methods such as
mean-field variational inference or stochastic-gradient Markov chain Monte
Carlo (SGMCMC). To investigate foundational questions in Bayesian deep
learning, we instead use full-batch Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) on modern
architectures. We show that (1) BNNs can achieve significant performance gains
over standard training and deep ensembles; (2) a single long HMC chain can
provide a comparable representation of the posterior to multiple shorter
chains; (3) in contrast to recent studies, we find posterior tempering is not
needed for near-optimal performance, with little evidence for a ""cold
posterior"" effect, which we show is largely an artifact of data augmentation;
(4) BMA performance is robust to the choice of prior scale, and relatively
similar for diagonal Gaussian, mixture of Gaussian, and logistic priors; (5)
Bayesian neural networks show surprisingly poor generalization under domain

class of non-Euclidean loss functions that frequently arise in statistical
machine learning and signal processing. These loss functions are often used for
certain types of tensor data, e.g., count and binary tensors, where the least

non-Euclidean losses are generally more challenging to handle. Non-Euclidean
CPD has attracted considerable interests and a number of prior works exist.
However, pressing computational and theoretical challenges, such as scalability
and convergence issues, still remain. This work offers a unified stochastic
algorithmic framework for large-scale CPD decomposition under a variety of
non-Euclidean loss functions. Our key contribution lies in a tensor fiber
sampling strategy-based flexible stochastic mirror descent framework.
Leveraging the sampling scheme and the multilinear algebraic structure of

Linear Models. Structured sparsity estimators in the least squares loss are
introduced by Stucky and van de Geer (2018) recently for fixed design and
normal errors. We extend their results to debiased structured sparsity
estimators with Generalized Linear Model based loss. Structured sparsity
estimation means penalized loss functions with a possible sparsity structure
used in the chosen norm. These include weighted group lasso, lasso and norms
generated from convex cones. The significant difficulty is that it is not clear
how to prove two oracle inequalities. The first one is for the initial
penalized Generalized Linear Model estimator. Since it is not clear how a
particular feasible-weighted nodewise regression may fit in an oracle
inequality for penalized Generalized Linear Model, we need a second oracle
inequality to get oracle bounds for the approximate inverse for the sample
estimate of second-order partial derivative of Generalized Linear Model.
  Our contributions are fivefold: 1. We generalize the existing oracle
inequality results in penalized Generalized Linear Models by proving the
underlying conditions rather than assuming them. One of the key issues is the
proof of a sample one-point margin condition and its use in an oracle
inequality. 2. Our results cover even non sub-Gaussian errors and regressors.
3. We provide a feasible weighted nodewise regression proof which generalizes
the results in the literature from a simple l_1 norm usage to norms generated
from convex cones. 4. We realize that norms used in feasible nodewise
regression proofs should be weaker or equal to the norms in penalized
Generalized Linear Model loss. 5. We can debias the first step estimator via
getting an approximate inverse of the singular-sample second order partial

http://arxiv.org/abs/2104.14210v2,FairDrop: Biased Edge Dropout for Enhancing Fairness in Graph Representation Learning,"Graph representation learning has become a ubiquitous component in many
scenarios, ranging from social network analysis to energy forecasting in smart
grids. In several applications, ensuring the fairness of the node (or graph)
representations with respect to some protected attributes is crucial for their
correct deployment. Yet, fairness in graph deep learning remains
under-explored, with few solutions available. In particular, the tendency of
similar nodes to cluster on several real-world graphs (i.e., homophily) can
dramatically worsen the fairness of these procedures. In this paper, we propose
a novel biased edge dropout algorithm (FairDrop) to counter-act homophily and
improve fairness in graph representation learning. FairDrop can be plugged in
easily on many existing algorithms, is efficient, adaptable, and can be
combined with other fairness-inducing solutions. After describing the general
algorithm, we demonstrate its application on two benchmark tasks, specifically,
as a random walk model for producing node embeddings, and to a graph
convolutional network for link prediction. We prove that the proposed algorithm
can successfully improve the fairness of all models up to a small or negligible
drop in accuracy, and compares favourably with existing state-of-the-art
solutions. In an ablation study, we demonstrate that our algorithm can flexibly
interpolate between biasing towards fairness and an unbiased edge dropout.
Furthermore, to better evaluate the gains, we propose a new dyadic group
definition to measure the bias of a link prediction task when paired with
group-based fairness metrics. In particular, we extend the metric used to
measure the bias in the node embeddings to take into account the graph
structure.","['Indro Spinelli', 'Simone Scardapane', 'Amir Hussain', 'Aurelio Uncini']","['cs.LG', 'stat.ML']",2021-04-29 08:59:36+00:00
http://arxiv.org/abs/2104.14132v3,Generalization Guarantees for Neural Architecture Search with Train-Validation Split,"Neural Architecture Search (NAS) is a popular method for automatically
designing optimized architectures for high-performance deep learning. In this
approach, it is common to use bilevel optimization where one optimizes the
model weights over the training data (inner problem) and various
hyperparameters such as the configuration of the architecture over the
validation data (outer problem). This paper explores the statistical aspects of
such problems with train-validation splits. In practice, the inner problem is
often overparameterized and can easily achieve zero loss. Thus, a-priori it
seems impossible to distinguish the right hyperparameters based on training
loss alone which motivates a better understanding of the role of
train-validation split. To this aim this work establishes the following
results. (1) We show that refined properties of the validation loss such as
risk and hyper-gradients are indicative of those of the true test loss. This
reveals that the outer problem helps select the most generalizable model and
prevent overfitting with a near-minimal validation sample size. This is
established for continuous search spaces which are relevant for differentiable
schemes. Extensions to transfer learning are developed in terms of the mismatch
between training & validation distributions. (2) We establish generalization
bounds for NAS problems with an emphasis on an activation search problem. When
optimized with gradient-descent, we show that the train-validation procedure
returns the best (model, architecture) pair even if all architectures can
perfectly fit the training data to achieve zero error. (3) Finally, we
highlight connections between NAS, multiple kernel learning, and low-rank
matrix learning. The latter leads to novel insights where the solution of the
outer problem can be accurately learned via efficient spectral methods to
achieve near-minimal risk.","['Samet Oymak', 'Mingchen Li', 'Mahdi Soltanolkotabi']","['stat.ML', 'cs.LG']",2021-04-29 06:11:00+00:00

the activation's heterogeneity across feature dimensions, samples, and layers.
These techniques can be readily applied to existing dynamic graph frameworks,

mainstream computer vision models for classification, detection, and
segmentation tasks. On all these tasks, ActNN compresses the activation to 2

appealing in that it has a data-dependent $O(\sqrt{T})$ regret bound when
objective functions are convex, where $T$ is a time horizon. It remains however
an open problem whether the convergence rate can be further improved without
sacrificing its generalization ability. %on how to exploit strong convexity to
further improve the convergence rate of AdaBelief. To this end, we make a first
attempt in this work and design a novel optimization algorithm called
FastAdaBelief that aims to exploit its strong convexity in order to achieve an
even faster convergence rate. In particular, by adjusting the step size that
better considers strong convexity and prevents fluctuation, our proposed
FastAdaBelief demonstrates excellent generalization ability as well as superior
convergence. As an important theoretical contribution, we prove that
FastAdaBelief attains a data-dependant $O(\log T)$ regret bound, which is
substantially lower than AdaBelief. On the empirical side, we validate our
theoretical analysis with extensive experiments in both scenarios of strong and
non-strong convexity on three popular baseline models. Experimental results are
very encouraging: FastAdaBelief converges the quickest in comparison to all
mainstream algorithms while maintaining an excellent generalization ability, in
cases of both strong or non-strong convexity. FastAdaBelief is thus posited as
a new benchmark model for the research community.","['Yangfan Zhou', 'Kaizhu Huang', 'Cheng Cheng', 'Xuguang Wang', 'Amir Hussain', 'Xin Liu']","['cs.LG', 'stat.ML']",2021-04-28 14:23:37+00:00

predict individual-level risk of ill health? (2) How much data do we need to
effectively predict ill health? (3) Are new methods required to process the
added complexity that new forms of data bring? The aim of the study is to apply
a machine learning approach to identify the relative contribution of personal,
social, health-related, biomarker and genetic data as predictors of future
health in individuals. Using longitudinal data from 6830 individuals in the UK
from Understanding Society (2010-12 to 2015-17), the study compares the
predictive performance of five types of measures: personal (e.g. age, sex),
social (e.g. occupation, education), health-related (e.g. body weight, grip
strength), biomarker (e.g. cholesterol, hormones) and genetic single nucleotide
polymorphisms (SNPs). The predicted outcome variable was limiting long-term
illness one and five years from baseline. Two machine learning approaches were
used to build predictive models: deep learning via neural networks and XGBoost
(gradient boosting decision trees). Model fit was compared to traditional
logistic regression models. Results found that health-related measures had the
strongest prediction of future health status, with genetic data performing
poorly. Machine learning models only offered marginal improvements in model
accuracy when compared to logistic regression models, but also performed well

of ML in situ sampling and satellite observations, and the extent to which ML
applications can advance theoretical oceanographic exploration, as well as aid
numerical simulations. Applications that are also covered include model error

training to learn a target distribution, these layer-wise subspaces
automatically discover a set of ""eigen-dimensions"" at each layer corresponding
to a set of semantic attributes or interpretable variations. By traversing the

with continuous changes corresponding to a specific semantic attribute. Taking
the human face for example, EigenGAN can discover controllable dimensions for
high-level concepts such as pose and gender in the subspace of deep layers, as
well as low-level concepts such as hue and color in the subspace of shallow
layers. Moreover, in the linear case, we theoretically prove that our algorithm

subgroups. However, subpopulation performance metrics are typically computed
using only data from that subgroup, resulting in higher variance estimates for
smaller groups. We devise a procedure to measure subpopulation performance that

certain other points which are only stationary in certain directions achieve
small test error. We then prove that for convolutional neural nets, there is an

pairwise manner plot the normalized bid values of some reference firm against
the normalized bids of any other firms participating in the same tenders as the
reference firm. Based on Japanese and Swiss procurement data, we construct such
graphs for both collusive and competitive episodes (i.e when a bid-rigging
cartel is or is not active) and use a subset of graphs to train the neural
network such that it learns distinguishing collusive from competitive bidding
patterns. We use the remaining graphs to test the neural network's
out-of-sample performance in correctly classifying collusive and competitive
bidding interactions. We obtain a very decent average accuracy of around 90% or
slightly higher when either applying the method within Japanese, Swiss, or
mixed data (in which Swiss and Japanese graphs are pooled). When using data
from one country for training to test the trained model's performance in the
other country (i.e. transnationally), predictive performance decreases (likely
due to institutional differences in procurement procedures across countries),
but often remains satisfactorily high. All in all, the generally quite high

to have $r^{\star}=1$, then the sharp RIP threshold for exact recovery is
improved to $\delta<1/(1+1/\sqrt{r})$.",['Richard Y. Zhang'],"['math.OC', 'cs.LG', 'stat.ML']",2021-04-21 23:07:18+00:00
http://arxiv.org/abs/2104.10785v4,Accurate and fast matrix factorization for low-rank learning,"In this paper, we tackle two important problems in low-rank learning, which
are partial singular value decomposition and numerical rank estimation of huge
matrices. By using the concepts of Krylov subspaces such as Golub-Kahan
bidiagonalization (GK-bidiagonalization) as well as Ritz vectors, we propose
two methods for solving these problems in a fast and accurate way. Our
experiments show the advantages of the proposed methods compared to the
traditional and randomized singular value decomposition methods. The proposed
methods are appropriate for applications involving huge matrices where the
accuracy of the desired singular values and also all of their corresponding
singular vectors are essential. As a real application, we evaluate the
performance of our methods on the problem of Riemannian similarity learning
between two various image datasets of MNIST and USPS.","['Reza Godaz', 'Reza Monsefi', 'Faezeh Toutounian', 'Reshad Hosseini']","['stat.ML', 'cs.CV', 'cs.LG']",2021-04-21 22:35:02+00:00
